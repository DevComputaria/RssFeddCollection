                            <p><strong>The Pentagon and Justice Department said they are investigating the alleged unauthorized disclosures</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Scores of secret US national security files have appeared online after another major leak, the New York Times reported, noting that the new documents include <em>&ldquo;sensitive&rdquo;</em> material related to Ukraine, China, the Middle East and terrorism. The breach comes just one day after other <em>&ldquo;top secret&rdquo;</em> papers showing US and NATO war plans in Ukraine made the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.ph/xRch4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new trove</a> of documents was spotted on Twitter and other sites on Friday afternoon, in what one senior US intelligence official described as a <em>&ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;</em> for Western security services, according to the Times. While the full scope of the leak has yet to be determined and the authenticity of the files remains unverified, the outlet suggested the latest breach could include <em>&ldquo;more than 100 documents&rdquo;</em> in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to another classified disclosure first reported on Thursday, some of the files detail intelligence related to the conflict in Ukraine. One <em>&ldquo;top secret&rdquo;</em> document shows a US assessment of the situation in the city of Artyomovsk (known as Bakhmut in Ukraine), which has largely come under Moscow&rsquo;s control after months of bitter fighting.</p>

<p>However, the new leak does not stop with Ukraine and covers a variety of other subjects, including <em>&ldquo;sensitive briefing slides on China, the Indo-Pacific military theater, the Middle East and terrorism,&rdquo;</em> the Times added, stating that the scale of the breach appears to have caught the White House <em>&ldquo;off guard.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Pentagon said on Thursday that it would investigate the matter, while the Justice Department later <a href="https://archive.ph/NkTVz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> its own separate probe. It said it was in communication with military officials, but neither have shared any additional details.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Following the prior leak earlier this week, officials said they were working to remove the material from the internet, though those efforts appear to have been unsuccessful so far, as many of the documents remain accessible on social media.</p>
<p>According to one unnamed official cited by the Times, determining the source of the breach would begin with <em>&ldquo;identifying which officials had access to them.&rdquo;</em> Staffers at several national security agencies described a <em>&ldquo;rush&rdquo;</em> to find the leaker, voicing concerns that this week&rsquo;s disclosures would turn into a <em>&ldquo;steady drip of classified information&rdquo;</em> published online.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The French president was accompanied by Ursula von der Leyen, who failed in her role of European unity-imposing overseer</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron&nbsp;has wrapped up a three-day visit to China, accompanied partly by European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen, who went home a day earlier.</p>
<p>The dual visit came at a time when&nbsp;EU nations, worried about a growing Sino-Russian partnership, are looking for ways to&nbsp;strengthen&nbsp;their own <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/we-cant-lose-china-eu-leaders-say-euco-summit-xi-jinping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diplomatic engagement</a> with Beijing.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen's presence on the trip was widely seen as a <em>&ldquo;check&rdquo;</em> on Macron, there to ensure he complied with &ldquo;<em>European unity</em>&rdquo; on the matter of the EU&rsquo;s relationship with China. Before the visit,&nbsp;she gave a hawkish&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2063" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">address</a>&nbsp;warning China against supporting Russia in the Ukraine conflict&nbsp;and slamming Beijing for becoming <em>&ldquo;more repressive at home and more assertive abroad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While she urged the bloc to reduce <em>&ldquo;dependencies&rdquo;</em> on China, she also opposed full&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;decoupling&rdquo;</em> of economies, as called for by the US.&nbsp;Enduring trade relations were made abundantly clear by the fact that Macron was accompanied by a 50-strong delegation of business leaders who came to Beijing to sign deals.</p>
<p>It is unusual that Macron, an advocate of the EU&rsquo;s so-called <em>&ldquo;strategic autonomy&rdquo;</em> in negotiating with other actors on the world stage, and von der Leyen, an ardent atlanticist who is reportedly in the wings to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-von-der-leyen-is-running-be-new-nato-head-the-sun-2023-03-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be the next NATO secretary general</a>, were both in China together.</p>
<p>Despite their somewhat conflicting agendas, their visit was a net positive for Beijing and a net negative for US&nbsp;attempts to force the EU to fully take its side in its own geopolitical crusade against Beijing. The US looks upon all attempts by the EU to engage with China with disdain, and does its best to undermine it where possible.</p>
<p>Likewise, when it comes to the Ukraine conflict, China&rsquo;s effort to open talks by presenting its 12-step peace plan was immediately dismissed by Washington, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accusing Beijing of providing <em>&ldquo;diplomatic cover&rdquo;</em> for what he called Russia&rsquo;s attempts to &ldquo;<em>freeze the war.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;However, Xi Jinping&rsquo;s recent visit to Moscow has apparently shown EU leaders, who would prefer the war to end rather than drag on indefinitely, the potential consequences of &ldquo;<em>losing China</em>&rdquo; &ndash; and now Macron is <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/574298-macron-xi-visit-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urging Xi to mediate</a> a return to the negotiating table by &ldquo;<em>bringing Russia to its senses</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other words, many EU leaders, bar the overzealous and fanatical ones in states such as Lithuania, now realize that they must pursue a diplomatic effort to <em>&ldquo;keep China on board,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;which in turn illustrates the tactical shrewdness of Xi Jinping in preserving his partnership with Moscow without explicitly endorsing the Ukraine conflict. This has given China geopolitical leverage.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that China has never sought to oppose Europe, but its principal objective has been to try and keep Europe out of the American camp at all costs. The EU, after all, collectively represents the largest export market China has in the developed world and is therefore critical to China&rsquo;s growth and development.</p>
<p>Of course, on the other hand, the US has long been pushing very aggressively to undermine China&rsquo;s prospects in the EU. It has been waging a public opinion war against Beijing, using its own state-sponsored think-tanks, and pushing issues such as human rights to create negative sentiment and to block engagement, such as on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which was proposed back in 2013 and is still pending ratification a decade later. Similarly, the US uses bilateral and unilateral diplomacy to undermine China&rsquo;s relationships with specific European countries in a bid to wreck its attempts to engage with the bloc as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, the US explicitly supported Lithuania in undermining the 'One China' principle by opening a &ldquo;<em>Taiwan representative office.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;It also forced the Netherlands to agree to new export controls on sending advanced lithography machines (used for making computer chips) to China. Similarly, because the EU could never agree to a comprehensive ban of Huawei&rsquo;s application in 5G networks in 2020, the US simply resorted to bilaterally approaching countries one by one, making them agree to the ban until those states that were not on board, such as Germany, were effectively isolated and could not drive the EU agenda.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the EU is a bloc which can only operate by consensus between all of its member states, but if the US can undermine that consensus, it can throw a spanner in the works and break the entire machine. This is why it is so difficult for Europe to truly create an <em>&ldquo;autonomous&rdquo;</em> foreign policy capable of serving coherent &ldquo;<em>European interests.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;This means when nations such as France and Germany declare their desire for engagement with China, they of course have influence, but the overall effect is never truly consistent. The bloc is being subjected to a constant tug of war in its foreign policy direction, which ultimately shows that Europe remains more of a passenger, rather than a player, in the world of US-China competition.</p>
<p>However, despite the traditional dominance of the US over Europe, Beijing is by no means out of the game, because as much as the US can play divide and conquer against EU countries, so can China &ndash; and the outcome of the visit demonstrates that very well. Having given von der Leyen and her message of&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;unity&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>a noticeably cooler reception, the Chinese hosted a cordial tea ceremony for Macron, after signing a joint communique that&nbsp;spoke at length about improving&nbsp;trade, economic and cultural ties, but made barely any mention of the main political sticking point between China and the EU &ndash; Beijing's good relations with Moscow and Xi's refusal to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine crisis.</p>
<p>For China, this is a clear win. For France, this is a win in terms of enduring business and economic relations with China, but a loss in&nbsp;that all of Macron's attempt to change Xi's mind on Putin and Ukraine&nbsp;were <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/574310-macron-xi-ukraine-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensively stonewalled</a>.</p>
<p>For von der Leyen, whose mission in Beijing was purely political,&nbsp;it was a complete failure. Not only did her message fall on deaf ears, the wooing of France continued unabated under her nose. But perhaps most importantly, the result of this visit dealt a blow to US agenda, showing that positive relations between China&nbsp;and the EU are worth working towards and Washington's attempts to drive wedges between them are, so far, futile.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>EU country increasingly against sanctions on Russia</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>A recent poll shows four out of ten Austrians want the embargo to end</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The percentage of Austrians who want the EU sanctions against Russia to be lifted has overtaken the embargo&rsquo;s supporters, but the residents of the central European country are polarized on the issue by age, income and political affiliation.</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the INSA opinion research institute survey published on Friday in the outlet <a href="https://exxpress.at/brandneue-insa-umfrage-oesterreicher-gegen-russland-sanktionen-vor-allem-juengere2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eXXpress</a>, 41% of Austrians want sanctions to end, 37% want them to continue, while 22% wouldn&rsquo;t say or didn&rsquo;t care &ndash; a much higher percentage than usual.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Support for the embargo came mainly from richer, older and left-wing Austrians. The 60 and up age group favored the sanctions by a 12-point spread, 49% to 37%. The youngest group surveyed, 16-29, showed only 22% in favor of the embargo to 39% opposed. The strongest opposition to the sanctions was among the 40-49 cohort, with 47% wanting them lifted.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Only 24% of those with a monthly income of &euro;1,000 ($1100) or less wanted the sanctions to continue, compared to 51% of the &euro;4,000 bracket.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The divide was also noticeable across the political spectrum. Whereas 73% of the Green voters wanted the sanctions to continue, 72% of the Freedom Party voters wanted them lifted. On the political left, only 31% opposed the sanctions, while that percentage rose to 59% on the political right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The telephone and online survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,000 Austrians, on April 3-4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The EU has imposed ten rounds of sanctions against Moscow starting in February 2022, citing the escalating conflict in Ukraine. The expected collapse of the Russian economy failed to materialize, however, while the blowback in the form of skyrocketing energy prices has caused a wave of bankruptcies and social unrest across the bloc.<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The suspect was gunned down after driving into a crowd in Tel Aviv, killing one and injuring six</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv that Israeli authorities described as an act of terrorism has killed one man and injured six more people, all of them reportedly tourists. Israeli police said they shot the perpetrator, identified as an Israeli Arab.</p>
<p>According to the Israeli media, a man opened fire on a busy Tel Aviv waterfront, and then drove into a group of people in the nearby Charles Clore Park. An Italian tourist around the age of 30 died on the scene.</p>
<p>Six people were injured in the ramming&nbsp;&ndash; ranging from a 17-year-old girl to a 70-year-old woman&nbsp;&ndash; and were taken to two area hospitals. One of the wounded is in critical condition, while others have minor to moderate injuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emergency service Magen David Adom has identified all of the victims as foreign tourists, though earlier reports said four of them were Israeli.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv police said one of their officers<em> &ldquo;neutralized the driver&rdquo;</em> after approaching the car &ndash; which had flipped over &ndash; and seeing the suspect reach for a weapon. The officer, who had been at a nearby gas station, responded to the scene alongside several municipal inspectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspect&rsquo;s identity has not been revealed, though local media outlets claimed he was <em>&ldquo;an Israeli Arab.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called up all military police reservists and Border Police in response to the incident. The attack comes amid the Israeli bombing of Gaza and Lebanon, in reprisal for Thursday&rsquo;s rocket attack, which Netanyahu has blamed on the Palestinian militant group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The growing popularity of the channel facilitates Russia’s “disinformation war” in the region, the outlet claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Politico has sounded the alarm over the growing prominence of RT&rsquo;s Arabic-language channel and website, warning that its success is all part of an alleged Russian <em>&ldquo;disinformation war&rdquo;</em> waged across the Middle East.</p>
<p>In an opinion piece published on Friday, H.A. Hellyer, a Carnegie Endowment scholar and a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and Cambridge University, bemoaned the lack of suppression of Russian media in the region.</p>
<p>Hellyer referred to the Western policy of banning and sanctioning Russian outlets with the <em>&ldquo;invasion of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> praising the <em>&ldquo;quick and decisive action&rdquo;</em> taken by the UK, the US and the EU against RT and Sputnik. It did not mention that Western hostility toward the outlets had arguably long preceded the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>Russian media has thrived in the region due to a lack of pressure and bans from Middle Eastern countries, the author writes, claiming the outlets are attempting to wage a disinformation campaign there by <em>&ldquo;saturating social media with Kremlin talking points and undermining opposition figures.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;RT Arabic is also one of the most popular news sites in the region, in some months outperforming even Al-Jazeera, while its YouTube channel has more dedicated subscribers than any other RT subsidiary,&rdquo;</em> Hellyer wrote, adding that its popularity only intensified after the beginning of the ongoing hostilities between Moscow and Kiev.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In total, RT Arabic&rsquo;s social media platforms have garnered a combined 804 million views &ndash; a number that&rsquo;s risen exponentially since February 2022.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hellyer also complained about RT Arabic&rsquo;s prolific social media team, claiming that the outlet <em>&ldquo;often posts content at two or three times the rate of Al-Jazeera or the BBC, and often multiple times.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The goal appears to be to overload the audience with a flurry of information that&rsquo;s then retweeted and reposted ad nauseam and, thus, also serves to crowd out dissenting voices,&rdquo;</em> the author wrote, warning that the social media presence is delivering <em>&ldquo;pro-Kremlin propaganda &hellip; directly to younger generations in the Arabic-speaking world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Politico piece is the latest in a series of op-eds published by Western media outlets in recent weeks that have brought attention to the growing prominence of RT Arabic. Late in March, Foreign Policy published a similar piece warning that Russia&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;disinformation machine&rdquo;</em> had a <em>&ldquo;Middle East advantage.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The article, penned by Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, also lamented that <em>&ldquo;in the Middle East, Russian state-run media have retained full access to airwaves throughout the Ukraine crisis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Nathaniel Greenberg, an associate professor of Arabic at George Mason University, wrote a similar piece in Euronews last week, claiming Moscow has been seeking to make Egypt <em>&ldquo;the linchpin&rdquo;</em> in the new Cold War with the West. The alleged goal, according to the author, owes much of its success to extensive <em>&ldquo;propaganda&rdquo;</em> and the <em>&ldquo;exploding&rdquo;</em> popularity of RT Arabic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Sharron Davies says that the sportswear brand is showing ‘disdain’ for women</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Sharron Davies, the former British Olympic swimmer and vocal critic of transgender athletes competing in women&rsquo;s sports, has called for a boycott of sports apparel giant Nike following its partnership with transgender TikTok personality Dylan Mulvaney. </p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Nobody really seems to be listening to the general public,&rdquo;</em> Davies said on Thursday to GB News. <em>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what seems to be incredibly frustrating. So, the only way we can actually make these companies and make governments listen is to boycott with our wallets.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transgender social media personality Mulvaney &ndash; who has also partnered with Bud Light &ndash; was featured in Instagram images modelling Nike&rsquo;s range of sports bras this week, clothing which Davies says <em>&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t apply&rdquo;</em> to Mulvaney, who has not yet had gender-reassignment surgery. </p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this total disdain that women are being treated to at the moment,&rdquo;</em> Davies added, <em>&ldquo;Particularly in the world of sport where physiology makes so much difference.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mulvaney has so far not yet commented on the controversy. Anheuser-Busch, which owns Bud Light, said through a spokesperson that the brand <em>&ldquo;works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of the many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Transgender participation in sports has become a fiercely-debated issue amid a wave of legislative proposals in Republican-led states in the US which have sought to impose various restrictions on trans athletes' abilities to participate in female sports. </p>
<p>Schools and colleges in the US, though, would be disallowed from imposing blanket bans on transgender athletes as part of a provision to existing gender-equity legislation proposed this week by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Another former Olympic athlete, Caitlyn Jenner, who is transgender, has also joined in the chorus of backlash against Nike, whom she described as <em>&ldquo;woke&rdquo;</em> and said that <em>&ldquo;inclusivity&rdquo;</em> should not come at the expense of the majority of people. </p>
<p>Like Davies, Jenner has been a noted critic of transgender athletes competing in sports against biologically-born women. Jenner did note, however, that she has no issue with Mulvaney pursuing sponsorship deals, as she has done herself in the past. </p>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, the GOP presidential candidate noted for his opposition to so-called &lsquo;wokeism,&rsquo; has also expressed his opposition to Nike&rsquo;s deal with Mulvaney, calling it the <em>&ldquo;worst kind of woke capitalism.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The Polish police have arrested a man for defacing a John Paul II statue following pedophilia revelations</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Two monuments to Pope John Paul II have been defaced over the past week in Poland, after a book and a documentary aired explosive allegations that he had tolerated pedophile priests during his term as the archbishop of Krakow. One man was arrested on Friday for the attack in Lodz.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Whatever one thinks of the Pope, vandalism is never the solution. It&rsquo;s hard to find words to describe such behavior on the anniversary of someone&rsquo;s death,&rdquo;</em> officials in the central Polish city said on April 2, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lodzpolska/posts/614529700718068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing</a> a photo of the defaced monument on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>By Monday morning, another monument to the pope, in Stalowa Wola in eastern Poland, was also defaced.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Lodz Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office announced the arrest of a 25-year-old man, who was charged with defacing the monument and insulting the feelings of believers. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison. The outlet <a href="https://www.rmf24.pl/regiony/lodz/news-pomnik-jana-pawla-ii-w-lodzi-oblany-farba-zarzuty-dla-25-lat,nId,6703666#crp_state=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMF24</a> claimed there were more perpetrators, and that the attack was caught on security cameras at the entrance to the cathedral.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The statue in Lodz had been doused with red paint, the pontiff&rsquo;s face had been painted yellow, and the pedestal inscribed with <em>&ldquo;maxima culpa&rdquo;</em> (ultimate fault). Authorities believe this was a reference to the title of Dutch journalist Ekke Overbeek&rsquo;s book, published in Poland last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong></strong>Overbeek has argued that the future pope, as archbishop of Krakow, covered up the sexual abuse of boys by at least three Catholic priests during the 1970s. Similar claims were made in a documentary journalist Marcin Gutowski made for the Polish channel TV24, which aired in early March.</p>
<p><strong></strong>John Paul II was born Karol Wojtyla, and is the only Pole to become the head of the Roman Catholic Church to date. From 1964 to his election in 1978, he was the archbishop of Krakow. His elevation has been widely credited with the rise of anti-Communist advocacy in Poland in the 1980s. John Paul II died in 2005 and was declared a saint in 2014.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Polish authorities have responded to the claims by saying all accusations of sexual abuse need to be thoroughly investigated, but defended the late pontiff by saying his critics relied on lies fabricated by the Communist government and that the Catholic church had been in a difficult situation at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Slovakia's Jaroslav Nad’ has suggested Russian technicians may have damaged jets that were later gifted to Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets belonging to the Slovak army may have been intentionally sabotaged by Russian engineers who worked on them before they were given to Ukraine, the country's Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad&rsquo; claimed on Friday.</p>
<p>As reported by Euractiv, Nad&rsquo;s statement came after former Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico criticized the government in Bratislava for giving up the valuable aircraft to Kiev.</p>
<p>Slovakia retired its fleet of MiG-29s last summer as most of the planes were not operational. Last month, the Slovak government announced that it would be giving 10 MiGs with engines and another three without engines to Ukraine&rsquo;s forces. Four of the jets have already been delivered and are patrolling the skies over Kharkov, according to Ukrainian officials, while the other nine are expected to arrive in the near future.</p>
<p>However, Nad&rsquo; now suggests that the jets may have been intentionally damaged by Russian technicians who had worked on the planes at the Sliac air base in Slovakia until last year.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Even the police were investigating it, based on our suspicions. There were parts in the engines of the aircraft that Slovak technicians accessed, and then there were parts that Russian technicians only accessed. The defects appeared only in those parts accessed by Russians,&rdquo;</em> Naď said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that while the investigation has failed to prove any ill intent on the part of the engineers, the defense ministry <em>&ldquo;felt a loss of confidence in the Russian technicians&rdquo;</em> because mistakes kept appearing<em> &ldquo;in places only they could get to.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Slovakia&rsquo;s former highest-ranking pilot, Lubomir Svoboda, also suggested there was<em> &ldquo;poor&rdquo;</em> workmanship on the jets. <em>&ldquo;We took over an engine from them that was supposed to last 350 hours. And in the end, it only flew 70 hours. What can we make of that?&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s embassy in Slovakia, meanwhile, has criticized officials for sending the jets to Ukraine, arguing that the move was <em>&ldquo;illegal&rdquo;</em> because it required Moscow&rsquo;s approval under bilateral agreements. It also warned that such deliveries could lead to<em> &ldquo;an unpredictable and dangerous escalation of the conflict.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that the MiG-29s would be destroyed by Russian forces just like any other Western weapons sent to the country. Peskov also said he had the impression that Kiev&rsquo;s allies were using Ukraine to simply <em>&ldquo;dispose of old hardware that they do not need anymore.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The council president of the country’s Evangelical Church Annette Kurschus emphasized a need for peace proposals</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The head of the Evangelical Church in Germany has rebuked high-profile Ukrainian officials for attacking a recent public appeal by renowned politicians for work on ending the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with newspaper Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger published on Thursday, Annette Kurschus said that she is angered by <em>&ldquo;this artificial alternative between weapons deliveries and talks.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While arms deliveries to Kiev are still necessary, in the clergywoman&rsquo;s eyes, equally important are <em>&ldquo;efforts [to bring about] talks&rdquo;</em> between Ukraine and Russia, she pointed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Kurschus,<em> &ldquo;negotiations on an equal footing don&rsquo;t come about on their own, they must be brought about.&rdquo;</em> She went on to state that she disagrees with Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Alexey Makeev, who characterized calls for a truce as cynical.<em> &ldquo;I refuse to dismiss the call for negotiations as cynical and naive,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>
<p>Her comments came in response to the harsh remarks made last week by Ukraine&rsquo;s former envoy Andrey Melnyk and by his successor in office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter last Saturday, Melnyk, who currently serves as Ukraine&rsquo;s Deputy Foreign Minister, told former historian Peter Brandt and several prominent German social democrats who&rsquo;d initiated the call for peace negotiations, to <em>&ldquo;go to hell with your senile idea to reach a quick ceasefire.&rdquo;</em> The outspoken diplomat added that the <em>&ldquo;Ukrainians reject this frippery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Echoing his sentiment, Kiev&rsquo;s current ambassador Makeev told German news agency DPA on Sunday that the appeal for peace in question is <em>&ldquo;pure cynicism in the face of the numerous victims of the Russian aggression.&rdquo;</em> The official went on to claim that the authors were merely trying to obfuscate<em> &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Titled <em>&ldquo;Make peace!,&rdquo;</em> the article was authored by Brandt and signed by a number of heavyweights of German and European politics, including ex-EU Commissioner G&uuml;nter Verheugen, former Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse and former SPD leader Andrea Ypsilanti.</p>
<p>The piece warns the German leadership that the continuation of fighting in Ukraine risks spreading the conflict further afield, with the <em>&ldquo;shadow of a nuclear war&rdquo;</em> hanging over Europe. The appeal evokes the policy of d&eacute;tente of the Cold War, arguing that it is as relevant as ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author and signatories conclude by calling on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with whom many of them share a party allegiance, to join forces with the likes of France, Brazil, China, India and Indonesia in a bid to bring about a swift cessation of hostilities in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Russian military will likely scrutinize comments made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken after he predicted a potential timeframe for a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview on Friday with Ouest-France and German media group Funke, Blinken stated that the US and its allies should <em>&ldquo;do everything... to help Ukraine reconquer the territories taken by Russia, including through a counteroffensive, expected in the coming weeks.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, Peskov noted that Russia uses a range of information in planning its operations in the conflict with Ukraine, and that Blinken&rsquo;s remarks appeared to be<em> &ldquo;a statement that is a subject for examination by our military.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They thoroughly track all the relevant information and take it into account when planning the continuation of the special military operation,&rdquo;</em> the presidential spokesman explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiev and its Western backers have increasingly talked up a major counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces, supposedly set to take place sometime during the spring and involving tanks and other hardware provided by the West, as well as Ukrainian troops trained abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advance will reportedly be aimed at restoring Ukraine&rsquo;s borders as they were before 2014. This includes the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics and Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions, which all voted to become part of Russia in referendums last autumn, as well as Crimea, which reunited with Moscow nine years ago.</p>
<p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy head of the Security Council, previously cast doubt on Ukraine&rsquo;s ability to carry out such a large-scale operation, arguing that the claims by officials in Kiev were merely<em> &ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On Thursday, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon had launched an investigation after a trove of classified data on US and NATO activities to prepare Kiev for a counteroffensive were leaked online. The papers, whose source is unclear, assessed areas such as troop strengths, timelines for arms shipments, and ammunition expenditure. However, they did not state when exactly the operation was scheduled to start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The former president is correct to describe the US as a ‘nation in decline,’ and he is the main symptom of this decline</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s 25-minute speech delivered at his Mar-a-Lago compound on Wednesday, following his indictment on felony charges in New York, marks his dramatic return to the center of American politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After languishing in the doldrums for the past few years, Trump is now back in the game with a vengeance &ndash; thanks to the decision by New York Attorney General Alvin Bragg to charge him with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Bragg&rsquo;s controversial decision to prosecute Trump may well turn out to be one of the most consequential misjudgements by a public official in recent American history.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s speech on Wednesday was a bravura performance. In apocalyptic tones &ndash; <em>&ldquo;our country is going to hell&rdquo;</em> &ndash; Trump painted a picture of a corrupt, crime-ridden and weak America, foolishly promoting a dangerous and unnecessary conflict in Ukraine, hurtling towards self-destruction. The US, Trump asserted, is a &ldquo;<em>failing nation &hellip; a nation in decline.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump himself is at the center of this grim prognosis proclaiming himself as the only politician who can &ldquo;<em>save our country.</em>&rdquo; In order to prevent this, he claimed, the elites responsible for America&rsquo;s current state of decline, including the Democrats, the FBI, the Department of Justice, George Soros, Facebook and Twitter, have now conspired to use a corrupt legal system to thwart his reelection. <em>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t beat us at the ballot box so they try and beat us through the law,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that Trump should turn his destructive ire upon the American legal system. He has always held contempt for the rule of law. Who can forget his <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-decision-trump-takes-credit-for-supreme-court-abortion-ruling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boasting of having stacked the Supreme Court</a> and his subsequent denunciation of his own appointees when they refused to legally sanction his claim that the 2020 election had been stolen? But in this speech, he went further than he has ever gone before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the charges brought by Attorney General Bragg, Trump claimed that &ldquo;<em>there is no case</em>&rdquo; and that Bragg &ndash; who he branded &ldquo;<em>a criminal&rdquo;</em> &ndash; knew that there was no case. He described the judge presiding over the case as a &ldquo;<em>Trump hating judge with a Trump hating wife&hellip; whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris.</em>&rdquo; According to the former President, the entire prosecution is something &ldquo;<em>right out of the old Soviet Union.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s denunciation of the legal system did not end there. He described the seizure of documents from Mar-a-Lago by the FBI as <em>&ldquo;illegal&rdquo;</em> and part of a campaign of <em>&ldquo;persecution&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;harassment&rdquo;</em> against him and his family.</p>
<p>The former president dismissed the investigation into alleged fraudulent practices by Trump&rsquo;s businesses in New York as <em>&ldquo;a persecution not an investigation&rdquo;</em> and accused Attorney General Leticia James of being a &ldquo;<em>racist in reverse&rdquo;</em> and a tool of the Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump went on to describe the Attorney General in Atlanta who is currently investigating him in relation to alleged electoral fraud during the 2020 election as a &ldquo;<em>racist Democrat Attorney General.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Bragg&rsquo;s prosecution, the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago and the other pending investigations, are, according to Trump, all aspects of a vast legal conspiracy &ndash; &ldquo;<em>our justice system has become lawless</em>&rdquo; &ndash; designed to destroy his prospects of being re-elected President in 2024.</p>
<p>It is a measure of America&rsquo;s irreversible decline as a functioning liberal democracy that a person who publicly expresses such views could be a serious candidate for the Presidency. Trump&rsquo;s encouragement of the January 6 riots and his persistent attempts to overturn the 2020 election result proved that he had absolute contempt for the democratic process. This week&rsquo;s speech proves that he has a similar contempt for the legal system and rule of law. No previous American president &ndash; not even Richard Nixon in his darkest days &ndash; would have even thought of behaving in such a manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two other aspects of Trump&rsquo;s speech are noteworthy. He repeated his standard critique of Joe Biden and the Democrats as having destroyed America and reduced it to a global laughing stock &ndash; focusing on illegal immigration, increasing crime in large cities, inflation and the weakening of the military. He described the Biden family as &ldquo;<em>criminals and crooks&rdquo;</em> and made much of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s various transgressions and the fact that he had not been prosecuted.</p>
<p>More importantly, Trump strongly criticized America&rsquo;s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. He claims the conflict would never have occurred if he had been President, and he asserted that Biden was running the risk of provoking an &ldquo;<em>all out nuclear war.&rdquo;</em> He also blamed Biden for having brought about a rapprochement between Russia and China that has weakened America&rsquo;s position globally.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Trump&rsquo;s prospects of winning the Republican nomination and winning the Presidential election in 2024 have been energized by the Bragg prosecution.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4zul6phwv0/Yahoo_20230331_Toplines_Crosstabs_Joined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polls</a> this week show that Trump has a commanding lead over Ron DeSantis as the preferred Republican Presidential nominee, with other candidates, including Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, having failed to gain virtually any support whatsoever. It is now clear that the primary will be a two-horse race.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s lead over DeSantis can be expected to widen, especially if the Bragg prosecution fails. And a bungled prosecution could very well catapult Trump into the White House in 2024.</p>
<p>It is important to note, that prosecutors must prove that Trump personally falsified various documents with the intention to defraud. Staff who&rsquo;ve worked with him before say he has an <a href="https://time.com/6215419/trump-legal-trouble-key-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aversion to putting anything in writing</a>, so proving that he was personally responsible for the falsification of documents, and that he had the requisite intention, will not be an easy task. Many legal experts, including Trump&rsquo;s opponents, have expressed doubts as to whether Bragg&rsquo;s prosecution will result in a conviction.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if Trump seeks to delay the Bragg prosecution or to have it expedited. In either case, he will use the prosecution to turbocharge his campaigns for the Republican nomination and the presidency, and any additional prosecutions that may be brought against him will likely be used to similar effect.</p>
<p>It is also relevant to note that the Bragg prosecution involves essentially trivial matters. After all, has no American President ever misused campaign funds in the past? This is far less serious, for example, than the alleged electoral fraud in Georgia in which Trump was personally involved, as his infamous telephone conversation with the Georgia Secretary of State shows. Trump would be in far graver difficulties if he had been prosecuted in relation to this matter or his involvement in the January 6 riots.</p>
<p>It is easy to dismiss the Mar-a-Lago speech as the conspiracy-ridden ravings of a demagogue.&nbsp; That, however, would be to seriously underestimate Trump&rsquo;s appeal to a substantial and growing portion of the American electorate &ndash; namely all those that have been left behind by globalization. He also personifies many of the grosser aspects of American popular culture, and this makes his political rhetoric extraordinarily effective in contemporary America.</p>
<p>It must also be conceded that, stripped of its conspiracy theory underpinnings, much of Trump&rsquo;s critique of Biden and contemporary America is essentially correct &ndash; and the fact that Trump is clearly incapable of solving the problems he draws attention to does not invalidate his criticisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially so in relation to Trump&rsquo;s opposition to Biden&rsquo;s fervent commitment to perpetuating the conflict in Ukraine. Popular support for Biden&rsquo;s continued aid to Ukraine is decreasing, and Trump&rsquo;s promise to end the conflict will no doubt attract large numbers of new voters to his cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s energy, belief in his own cause, and campaigning ability stand in stark contrast to Biden &ndash; who is becoming progressively more fragile and looks like a doddering politician going through the motions. Anyone who doubts this should compare Trump&rsquo;s Mar-a-Lago speech with Biden&rsquo;s unimpressive speech delivered after the recent Nashville school shooting.</p>
<p>Whatever happens next year, the apparently terminal decline that has beset America in recent decades &ndash; so graphically and not inaccurately described by Trump this week &ndash; is certain to endure.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s continuing attacks on the basic institutions that underlie American liberal democracy will no doubt intensify over the coming months and can only further weaken those already fragile bodies, and his campaign for the presidency will only increasingly divide and coarsen American politics and society.</p>
<p>Donald Trump was correct to describe America as &ldquo;<em>a nation in decline&rdquo;</em> this week, but he omitted to say that the most obvious and egregious symptom of that irreversible decline is none other than Trump himself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Ma Ying-jeou became the island state’s first-ever former president to visit mainland China</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Ma Ying-jeou, president of Taiwan between 2008 and 2016, has warned that the island state might in future be forced to choose between <em>&ldquo;peace and war&rdquo;</em> as he criticized Taiwan&rsquo;s current leadership while concluding an historic visit to China.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our administration continues to lead Taiwan to danger,&rdquo;</em> Ma said on Friday after returning from Shanghai. <em>&ldquo;The future is a choice between peace and war.&rdquo;</em> He added that Taiwan and China could potentially share a <em>&ldquo;common political basis&rdquo;</em> which would prove to be beneficial to the Taiwanese population.</p>
<p>Ma led Taiwan for eight years as the head of the Kuomintang (KMT) government, which favors close ties with Beijing, which itself claims sovereignty over the island. He is the first former Taiwanese leader ever to have visited mainland China since civil war fractured the Asian country and prompted the Republic of China government to flee to Taiwan in 1949 after its defeat by Mao Zedong&rsquo;s Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s 12-day trip saw him visit memorial sites and cemeteries, including the tomb of his grandfather in Hunan Province, according to a report by China&rsquo;s Xinhua News Agency on Friday. It added that the visit <em>&ldquo;offered a window for compatriots at home and abroad into the kinship of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>He also said he hoped his coming to China would help ensure <em>&ldquo;Taiwan has a future of real peace and safety.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s current leader, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was critical of Ma&rsquo;s diplomatic venture into China. She said in a statement that it showed he has become an <em>&ldquo;accomplice&rdquo;</em> of the One China principle, which advocates a position that Beijing is the legitimate sovereign ruler of Taiwan.</p>
<p>However, Tsai also indicated that Ma&rsquo;s cordial visit to Beijing showed that Taiwan and China could in future hold diplomatic discussions to show that both are part of a single China, even if they hold separate definitions of the term.</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s visit was conducted amid heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait following a meeting between Tsai and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the USA this week. Earlier this year Tsai proposed renewed talks with Beijing to <em>&ldquo;maintain stability&rdquo;</em> in the region. China, which views Tsai as a separatist, suspended cross-strait discussions when she assumed power in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Hopes abound for a deal on a “permanent ceasefire” with Houthi leaders by the end of April</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A delegation representing Saudi Arabia and Oman is due to meet with the Houthi leadership in Sanaa next week to sign a permanent ceasefire ending the eight-year war in Yemen, several outlets have reported, citing officials familiar with the talks.</p>
<p>Sources told Reuters that an agreement could be announced by April 20, the eve of the Muslim holiday of Eid-al Fitr which marks the end of Ramadan.</p>
<p>UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg was in Muscat earlier this week, where he met with senior Omani and Houthi officials to discuss the peace process.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Saudi-led coalition lifted its naval blockade of Yemen, allowing most ships to dock directly in Aden and other southern ports without stopping in Jeddah for security checks. The blockade was imposed in 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition invaded Yemen on behalf of the government the Houthis had deposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Lebanon-based outlet Al-Mayadeen reported that Riyadh had summoned leaders of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government on Friday, to brief them on the talks with the Houthis. Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman presented <em>&ldquo;the solution for a way out of the war on Yemen,&rdquo;</em> the outlet&rsquo;s sources said.</p>
<p>According to Al-Mayadeen, the Saudi plan envisions extending the ceasefire by another year, followed by steps to reopen Yemeni ports. Riyadh is then expected to officially announce the end of the war and its intervention in Yemen.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and the UN will subsequently sponsor talks between the Houthis and rival Yemeni factions, seeking a two-year transition period to establish a new government, reports have indicated.</p>
<p>The diplomatic breakthrough after eight years of fighting was made possible by last month&rsquo;s agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to re-establish diplomatic relations, brokered by China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to UN estimates, the conflict in Yemen has claimed at least 377,000 lives, of which 150,000 were due to violence and the rest from starvation and disease. Another 4 million people have been displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The measures come in response to the encounter between Taipei's leader and the American House speaker</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Chinese government has imposed sanctions on America&rsquo;s Hudson Institute and Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, as well as executives from the two organizations, after they hosted Taiwan&rsquo;s president during her recent trip to the US. Beijing has also taken measures against Taiwan&rsquo;s envoy to Washington.</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that the organizations and individuals were being sanctioned for their roles in the meeting between Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this week in California.</p>
<p>On Friday, the ministry announced that both US institutions are now banned from cooperating with any individuals, universities, or institutions under Beijing&rsquo;s jurisdiction, including those in Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>According to the statement, both the Reagan Library and the Hudson Institute &ndash; which is a Washington DC-based think tank &ndash; had provided a &ldquo;<em>platform and convenience to Taiwan separatist activities.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several leading executives from the two entities, including Hudson Institute officials Sarah May Stern and John Walters, and Joanne Drake of the Reagan Library, will be denied Chinese visas and will have any assets frozen that they may own in the country.</p>

<p>Sanctions were also placed on two more organizations &ndash; one from Taiwan and the other from the US &ndash; as well as Taipei&rsquo;s representative in America, Hsiao Bi-khim. Hsiao is already on a Chinese sanctions list for her involvement in the arrangement of the visit by then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the self-governing island in August of last year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Tsai sat down with McCarthy and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California despite China&rsquo;s stern warnings.</p>
<p>The Hudson Institute conferred its global leadership award on&nbsp;Taiwan&rsquo;s president last Thursday.</p>
<p>During her meeting with McCarthy, Tsai thanked Washington for its commitment to protecting Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>way of life,</em>&rdquo; while the US official stressed the importance of relations between Washington and Taipei.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949, when the losing side in the Chinese civil war fled to the island and established its own administration. While only a handful of nations have recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state, the US has long maintained close, unofficial ties with Taipei, both militarily and economically. Formally, Washington still professes to adhere to the &lsquo;One-China&rsquo; principle.</p>
<p>Beijing considers the island to be an inalienable part of its territory that has been seized by separatists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US-led NATO military bloc has expanded once again, extending its border with Russia by almost 1300km.</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>This week, Finland officially became the 31st member state of NATO. Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto finalized the process by handing over the accession documentation to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.</p>
<p>The move&nbsp;may further aggravate tensions between Russia and the West. Analysts in Moscow argue that Helsinki has undermined its own security in a misguided effort to strengthen it.</p>

<h2><strong>A short and winding road</strong></h2>
<p>Finland has joined the US-led bloc before&nbsp;Sweden, which is something few experts had anticipated. Stockholm is still struggling to gain Turkish approval for its candidature, due to a dispute. Both states&nbsp;applied for membership in May 2022, citing&nbsp;the threat posed by &ldquo;an aggressive neighbor&rdquo; after Russia attacked&nbsp;Ukraine.</p>
<p>NATO did not accept them off the bat, however, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-12268949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledging</a> their readiness, because of tensions over the support of Kurdish organizations and questions regarding the extradition of individuals charged with terrorism and participation in the 2016 coup attempt in T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>Hungary also tried to slow down the process. Prime Minister Viktor Orban&nbsp;<a href="https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/17134921?ysclid=lg2bp0kp8d695284289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a>&nbsp;his parliament&rsquo;s concerns over the move being potentially damaging to NATO-Russia relations.</p>
<p>For Finland the process eventually took a year. On March 30, the Turkish parliament ratified Helsinki&rsquo;s accession protocol, and Budapest did the same on March 27.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What NATO gets</strong></h2>
<p>As a new NATO member state, Finland is bringing to the table&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/CBMFI23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mix</a> of advanced Western weapons and last-century Soviet hardware. A big part of the country&rsquo;s artillery force&nbsp;is comprised of Soviet-made weaponry such as the M46 and 2A36 Giatsint-B field guns and the D30 and 2S1 Gvozdika howitzers. Half of Finland&rsquo;s grouping&nbsp;of IFVs consists of Swedish CV-9030s, and another half of Soviet BMP-2s.</p>
<p>Helsinki&rsquo;s Armed Forces also boast the home-made Patria APC, a modular-design vehicle that can act as a light tank with a large-caliber main gun, or carry a remote-controlled gun and rocket combat module. Poland&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/01/04/2023/642801df9a7947a987629151?ysclid=lg2c9q5kom90683836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imports</a> them under the name of Rosomak. A total of 900 different versions of Patria APCs have been built since 2001. Also, in 2012, Croatia&rsquo;s Defense Ministry exported 40 to 50 Patria AMV vehicles built under license by national company Duro Dakovic Special Vehicle. In total, Zagreb&nbsp;has purchased 126 Patria AMVs, with six of them built in Finland.</p>
<p>Finland&rsquo;s Air Force mostly consists of foreign-made aircraft. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://it.insideover.com/difesa/riservisti-e-mezzi-moderni-come-organizzato-lesercito-finlandese.html?utm_source=ilGiornale&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=article_redirect&amp;_ga=2.204050320.1209689967.1652258806-1270191421.1638868035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Over</a>, it&nbsp;has 64 American-built F/A-18 Hornet fighters fitted with electronics and control systems mostly made domestically. The fleets service life is expected to expire by 2030, so the country is already looking for upgrades. The current fighters are expected to be replaced with a similar number of fifth-gen F-35A multirole aircraft in a procurement deal already&nbsp;<a href="https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/-/the-lockheed-martin-f-35a-lightning-ii-is-finland-s-next-multi-role-fighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a>.</p>

<p>Finland&rsquo;s army operates some 215 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) of different types, nine of which are the MQ-9 Reapers, Inside Over says.</p>
<p>Mostly focused on coastal operations, the Finnish Navy is trained and armed to protect the country&rsquo;s territorial waters in the Baltic Sea and quickly strike enemy vessels, to defend transport routes and straits, and to conduct reconnaissance missions,&nbsp;<a href="https://russiancouncil.ru/analytics-and-comments/analytics/chem-oboronyaetsya-finlyandiya/?ysclid=lg1vf8xgzs217013654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> Sergey Andreyev, an expert with the Russian Council on Foreign Affairs. The Finnish Navy has 17 minesweepers of different types and eight high-speed missile boats: four of Hamina-class and four of Rauma-class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finland operates German Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks along with some pre-owned Leopard 2A6 tanks&nbsp;<a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-7994226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased</a> from the Netherlands in 2015.</p>
<p>The Finnish Defense Forces have about 21,500 men and women on active duty. The country can also count on some 900,000 reservists who have completed military service.</p>
<p>However, experts polled by RT believe that NATO&rsquo;s primary gain in admitting Finland is to expand the bloc&rsquo;s influence and get closer to Russia&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Like any bureaucratic organization, the alliance in this case benefits through expanding its reach and influence. In addition, it is a way of limiting Russia&rsquo;s influence,&rdquo;</em> says Director of the Institute of Strategic Assessments Sergey Oznobishchev.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NATO is trying to keep expanding, seeing Russia as its main adversary. It is getting as close as possible, setting up its infrastructure in the real vicinity of Russia, which is important for NATO and certainly dangerous for Russia,&rdquo;</em> says Vladimir Bruter, an expert at the International Institute for Humanitarian and Political Studies.</p>
<p>The head of the Analytical Department at the Institute for Political and Military Analysis (IPWA), Alexander Khramchikhin, takes a different view. According to him, <em>&ldquo;NATO does not benefit from Finland&rsquo;s membership. Quite the opposite, it only increases the liabilities for the alliance.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2>What it means for Russia</h2>
<p>Finland&rsquo;s accession to NATO will only increase tensions on the global scene, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned. He described the expansion of the bloc as an encroachment on Russia&rsquo;s security and national interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That is how we see this development. It forces us to take countermeasures to ensure [Russia&rsquo;s] security, both tactically and strategically,&rdquo;</em> Peskov explained.</p>

<p>He pointed out, however, that Russia&rsquo;s issue with Finland is &lsquo;fundamentally different'&rsquo; to the conflict with Kiev and that, unlike Ukraine, the Nordic nation has never been &ldquo;anti-Russian&rdquo; or had any disputes with Moscow.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in response to Finland joining NATO, Moscow has already vowed to boost its defense capabilities in Russia&rsquo;s western and northwestern regions. It is not yet clear, however, in what specific form.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If other NATO members deploy their forces and equipment on Finnish territory, we will take additional steps to ensure Russia&rsquo;s security,&rdquo;</em> Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned the day before Helsinki&rsquo;s accession to the alliance.</p>
<p>Work is already being done to that end. For example, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced earlier this year that a new army corps will be formed on the border with Finland, in Karelia and the region around St. Petersburg, as part of the effort to bolster Russia&rsquo;s armed forces in that part of the country. The corps will consist of three motorized rifle divisions and two airborne divisions of the Russian Airborne Forces.</p>
<p>According to military observer Colonel Mikhail Khodaryonok, Moscow will focus on strengthening ground and coastal troops in the region and expanding the presence of Russian missile troops and artillery.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It is likely that these new formations will include brigades operating Iskander-M missile systems and heavy artillery brigades carrying nuclear ammunition,&rdquo;</em> noted Khodaryonok.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the expert, should things escalate to a stage where Russia has to plan combat operations in the region, Moscow will most likely consider long-range high-precision strikes on targets in Finland and Sweden, such as can be carried out by long-range aircraft carrying cruise missiles or naval forces carrying Kalibr missiles.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Given NATO&rsquo;s superiority in terms of conventional arms, Moscow would do well to consider planting nuclear land mines along the state border with the alliance&rsquo;s new member states.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Still, any defensive operation of this scale must be approved first. All military units must be formed, and their deployment planned out. Other workflows to implement include coordination, command and control chains, as well as all kinds of supply routes and military logistics. Naturally, the expenses associated with such an operation would be considerable. But in this case, national defense and security interests clearly take priority,&rdquo;</em> summarized Khodaryonok.</p>
<h2>Why Finland wants it</h2>
<p>Last May, Finland&rsquo;s then prime minister, Sanna Marin, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera that the question of NATO deploying nuclear weapons or opening bases in Finland was not part of Helsinki&rsquo;s membership negotiations with the alliance.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Nobody will come to us to impose nuclear weapons or permanent bases on us if we don't want them. So I think that this topic is not on the agenda,&rdquo;</em> she said. According to the prime minister, NATO is not interested in stationing its forces or nuclear weapons in Finland.</p>
<p>Marin emphasized that Finland has invested heavily in its security as <em>&ldquo;a small country&rdquo;</em> that <em>&ldquo;has an aggressive neighbor,&rdquo;</em> but called the application for NATO membership <em>&ldquo;an act of peace&rdquo;</em> rather than war. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about war never returning to Finland,&rdquo;</em> said Marin, who asserted that Helsinki&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;will always try to find diplomatic solutions to any problems.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Yet, it is not peace that Helsinki is likely to secure for itself by joining NATO, but the loss of its status and sovereignty, according to military journalist Ivan Konovalov.</p>
<p>He told RT: <em>&ldquo;Up to now, Finland enjoyed a very special status of a neutral state on the international scene. Even back in the Cold War times, when the USSR was in a standoff with NATO, the neutral stance made Finland stand out as a player on the global scene, unlike many others. But now it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s going to be a political death for Finland that will now become just one of the many nations doing the bidding of Washington. It will lose its political uniqueness and get assimilated by NATO.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Alexander Khramchikhin, this decision is against Finland&rsquo;s own interests because it will only undermine the nation&rsquo;s security, even if Helsinki thinks it&rsquo;s going to be the other way round. <em>&ldquo;This has been an irrational decision inspired by fear,&rdquo;</em> he believes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What&rsquo;s next?</strong></h2>
<p>The relationship between Moscow and Helsinki has taken a turn for the worse recently, and as Vladimir Bruter sees it, it&rsquo;s not going to get any better.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The only chance to build a balanced relationship is for the West to stop talking about Russia as a force to contain. Russia is either a partner or an adversary. There&rsquo;s no way for the West to continue containing Russia and maintaining a good relationship with it at the same time. Russia already gave it too much time, despite putting itself at an obvious disadvantage because, as we can see, the West took advantage of this time to keep treating Russia as an economy and a political and military force to contain. I hope Moscow won&rsquo;t allow that ever again,&rdquo;</em> Bruter commented.</p>

<p>Sergey Oznobishchev believes that although Finland&rsquo;s accession to NATO is against Russia&rsquo;s long-term interests, it does not pose any immediate or overwhelming threat. A lot will depend on how well Moscow and Helsinki will work on salvaging the relationship the two nations used to enjoy. According to Oznobishchev, they have a solid foundation to help them with that, i.e. <em>&ldquo;all those decades of friendship and good neighborly relationship with Helsinki.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Now is a good time to start working on this,&rdquo;</em> he argued. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to focus on stabilizing Russia&rsquo;s relationship with Finland and Sweden while we have anything that can still be saved. So far these two nations haven&rsquo;t been overly unfriendly. The matter of essence for Russia is that they don&rsquo;t let their territories be used by NATO to increase its military presence and to build up military capabilities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to Alexander Khramchikhin, Russia's relations with all Western countries have deteriorated so much that<em> "the next stage can only be a direct war, which is not likely to happen."</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think that we need to continue the endless whining about the restoration of relations with the West. It will never happen, and we need to understand this,&rdquo; </em>he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US and its allies have been working for years to reduce RT&rsquo;s international presence, claiming that the outlet serves as an instrument of Russian propaganda. After the conflict in Ukraine escalated last year, many Western nations demanded that platforms ban RT content from being shown on their territory.</p>

                            <p><strong>Two crew members of the pleasure boat Andromeda had fake passports, according to the outlet</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>German investigators have discovered traces of explosives on the Andromeda yacht linked to the Nord Stream sabotage last September, the New York Times has reported.</p>
<p>The information came from three unnamed German officials, the&nbsp;newspaper claimed&nbsp;in an article on Friday.</p>
<p>The same sources claimed that two out of the six crew members on the <em>&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;</em> boat had used fake Bulgarian passports during the alleged operation against the gas pipelines.</p>
<p>In early March the Times had reported, citing US officials, that a <em>&ldquo;pro-Ukrainian group&rdquo;</em> might&rsquo;ve been behind the attack that disabled the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which were built to deliver Russian gas to Europe via Germany. The paper&rsquo;s anonymous sources stressed that <em>&ldquo;no American or British nationals were involved&rdquo;</em> in the sabotage of the key energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>The vessel, which had allegedly been rented by the perpetrators to carry out the attack, was soon identified as the yacht Andromeda. The boat is now sitting in dry dock overlooking the Baltic Sea in north-eastern Germany, with<em> &ldquo;its innards pulled out by investigators,&rdquo;</em> the NYT said.</p>

<p>Kremlin press-secretary Dmitry Peskov suggested earlier that the articles about Andromeda&rsquo;s involvement were distributed by the Western media in order to divert attention from the report by veteran American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, which came shortly before the Western media reports and blamed Washington for the sabotage.</p>
<p>According to an informed source who talked with Hersh, explosives were planted on the pipelines in the Baltic Sea back in June 2022 by US Navy divers during a NATO exercise, and detonated remotely two months later on the order of American leader Joe Biden. The White House has rejected as <em>&ldquo;utterly false and complete fiction&rdquo;</em> the findings of the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist</p>
<p>In its report on Friday, the NYT also quoted Johannes Riber, a naval officer and analyst at Denmark&rsquo;s Institute for Strategy and War Studies, who also questioned claims of a 50-foot (15-meter) yacht being capable of carrying out an attack of such scale, likening them to a <em>&ldquo;James Bond&rdquo;</em> theory.</p>
<p>Andromeda could&rsquo;ve well been a decoy or part of a broader mission, Riber suggested. But planting powerful explosives at the pipelines would&rsquo;ve likely required an undersea drone or a mini-submarine, and a professional ship to transport it, he pointed out.</p>

<p>However, the article also contained comments by an unnamed pipeline expert and a professional diver, who both claimed that small bombs could&rsquo;ve been enough to cripple the infrastructure if they were placed near a seam of the pipeline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The Southeast Asian country was the target of extensive bombing between 1964 and 1973</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>More than 1.8 million unexploded bombs were cleared in Laos between 1996 and February 2023, the Southeast Asian country&rsquo;s Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare revealed this week.</p>
<p>A total of 1,808,254 unexploded ordnances (UXOs) were removed from an area covering 80,000 hectares, making the land safe for farming and other forms of agricultural development, according to Minister Padeumphone Sonthany.</p>
<p>The figures were announced at a press conference in the country&rsquo;s capital Vientiane on Tuesday on the 18th annual International Day for UXO/Mine Awareness.</p>
<p>Laos is, per capita, the most heavily-bombed country in the world. From 1964 to 1973, the US military dropped more than two million tons of bombs on the nation during the Vietnam War &ndash; more than on Germany and Japan combined throughout World War II. It is estimated that around 30% of the bombs dropped did not explode.</p>

<p>The US conducted prolonged bombing campaigns &ndash; the so-called &lsquo;Secret War&rsquo; &ndash; in Laos during the Vietnam War in a bid to disrupt supply lines between the country and Vietnam. The scale of the attacks, which were conducted in secrecy by the CIA, were revealed during a 1971 congressional hearing, as well as by US media investigations.</p>
<p>Of the 1.8 million UXOs removed and safely detonated during the period, 1,056,393 were cluster bombs. Another 4,336 were characterized as &lsquo;large&rsquo; bombs, and 2,456 were landmines. Some 745,069 of other types of munitions were included in the statistics reported by China&rsquo;s Xinhua News Agency, which cited Laotian media reports from last Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report said that 2,846 people had been involved in UXO-related accidents between 2015 and 2022, and that people from 4,092 villages across the country had been educated about the risks posed by UXOs. It added that the munitions continue to pose a grave threat to civilians and remain a barrier to increased agricultural production.</p>
<p>Rice is a key agricultural product in Laos, with over 60% of arable land used for its cultivation.</p>
<p>It is estimated that around 80 million unexploded live bomblets remain obscured in Laos, a product of the 270 million cluster bombs previously dropped on the country by US forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The top US diplomat reportedly acknowledged lapses in planning and executing the withdrawal, after the White House blamed Trump</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has acknowledged failures in the Afghanistan pull-out, while refusing to release an internal review on the debacle to avoid exposing <em>&ldquo;vulnerabilities and deficiencies,&rdquo;</em> Politico revealed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The remarks were reportedly part of a closed-door meeting between Blinken and his staff. The news outlet said it was given access to the event, which was partially conducted online.</p>
<p>The secretary of state spoke to US diplomats after the White House released an After Action Review on Afghanistan, in which it blamed former President Donald Trump for setting up unfavourable terms for his successor, Joe Biden, leading to the chaotic pullout.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Blinken alternated between chief consoler of the department he leads and Cabinet member defending the administration and his own conduct,&rdquo;</em> Politico wrote, describing the State Department&nbsp;event.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Blinken&nbsp;listed five key lessons learned from the Afghanistan experience, identified in the State Department review. It was led by veteran diplomat Daniel Smith, who&nbsp;investigated the events in the country from January 2020 to the end of August 2021.</p>

<p>The report found that the US diplomatic service failed to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a withdrawal amid a collapse of the US-backed government in Kabul. The last stage of the Western departure occurred after the Taliban seized control of the Afghan capital.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was seen as a very low probability, but obviously, potentially very high impact event and more could and should have been done to prepare for it,&rdquo;</em> Blinken said.</p>
<p>The State Department&rsquo;s contingency planning was apparently <em>&ldquo;inhibited&rdquo;</em> by optics considerations. There was concern that an open preparation to pull the plug <em>&ldquo;might send the wrong signal [to the Afghan government] that we&rsquo;d lost confidence in it,&rdquo;</em> the secretary explained.</p>
<p>Other findings related to organizational problems, unclear priorities, and a failure to properly track US citizens in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session after his speech, Blinken was asked whether he would make public his department&rsquo;s assessment of the botched withdrawal. He declined to do so, citing a reluctance to expose <em>&ldquo;the vulnerabilities and deficiencies that we have&rdquo;</em> while they are being addressed. Such information <em>&ldquo;would not be good to share in a broad way&rdquo;</em> he argued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Northern Irish authorities have reportedly cautioned that “dissident groups” could spark disorder</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has warned of potential terror attacks and public disorder over the Easter weekend, according to reports on Friday. The news comes just days before US President Joe Biden is due to visit the region with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne was cited as saying at a meeting on Thursday that officers would be moved to frontline duties for extended shifts to counter any potential threats. He noted that he was being forced to employ policing strategies that hadn&rsquo;t been used for years, which reflected the <em>&ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;</em> ahead of this weekend.</p>
<p>According to The Telegraph, Byrne stated that attacks are <em>&ldquo;highly likely right across Northern Ireland&rdquo;</em> and could target police officers and their families, as well as prison officers and military personnel. The authorities believe that <em>&ldquo;dissident terrorists&rdquo;</em> could resort to gun and bomb attacks, he is said to have warned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton stated that the PSNI has <em>&ldquo;very strong community intelligence&rdquo;</em> that attacks are being planned in Derry/Londonderry near the UK-Irish border on Easter Monday. That date will mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The treaty, signed on April 10, 1998, ended a nearly 30-year conflict between nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland and unionists who wish to remain in the UK. The country has since witnessed only sporadic attacks on security forces, carried out by splinter groups of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that opposed the accord.</p>
<p>Last month, UK intelligence agency MI5 raised the terror threat level in Northern Ireland from &lsquo;substantial&rsquo; to &lsquo;severe&rsquo;, suggesting an attack is highly likely. The move followed an attack in February on Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell, who was shot multiple times by two gunmen suspected of being part of the New Irish Republican Army (New IRA) &ndash; a dissident republican splinter group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unionist DUP and nationalist Sinn Fein parties both condemned the shooting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>It’s not the first time that the French president’s opponents tried to torch La Rotonde</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Demonstrators protesting against Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s pension reform have set fire to the French president&rsquo;s favorite Paris restaurant, La Rotonde.</p>
<p>Some 300 rioters clashed with police outside the posh eatery on the iconic Boulevard du Montparnasse&nbsp;in Paris on Thursday, local media reported, citing authorities.</p>
<p>Stones, bottles and flares were tossed at the security forces, eventually leading to the branded red awnings on the front of La Rotonde catching fire. Firefighters, who were swift to arrive on the scene, did not allow the flames to spread further and extinguished the blaze, according to the media.</p>
<p>Macron chose La Rotonde to celebrate his victory in the presidential election in 2017. He has also visited the expensive restaurant on many other occasions, occasionally dining there with foreign leaders. The French president previously told reporters that he developed a fondness for the place during his student years.</p>

<p>Recently, the bistro has become a frequent target of Macron&rsquo;s opponents, who accuse him of being <em>&ldquo;the president of the rich.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In January 2020, a fire on the restaurant's terrace lead to the arrest of a member of the Yellow Vests protest movement on suspicion of arson.</p>
<p>La Rotonde was opened in 1903 and became popular among the creative intellectuals in Paris between the two world wars. It has been visited by the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Jean Cocteau, Guillaume Apollinaire, and others.</p>

<p>Since January, France has been&nbsp;gripped by large-scale and often violent protests over the government&rsquo;s decision to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p>
<p>Tensions escalated further last month after Macron used executive privilege to pass the pension reform bill without a parliamentary vote.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Republican-controlled Tennessee House of Representatives has ousted two Democrats after they staged a demonstration</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Tennessee House of Representatives voted on Thursday to expel two Democratic lawmakers, after they were accused of breaching rules of conduct by holding a gun-control protest on the floor of the chamber.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden was quick to criticize the move by the Republican-led legislature, describing it as &ldquo;<em>undemocratic.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, Representatives Justin Jones and Justin Pearson disrupted House proceedings by leading chants from the floor with a bullhorn, claiming that Republicans had failed to address the issue of gun control in the wake of a mass shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville late last month.</p>
<p>Jones was expelled by a vote of 72 to 25, while 69 lawmakers backed the removal of Pearson, who had only assumed office on March 27. Fellow Democrat Gloria Johnson narrowly escaped the same fate as the resolution to oust her failed by a single vote.</p>
<p>Only a handful of such cases have taken place since the end of the American Civil War.</p>
<p>According to The Tennessean newspaper, protesters supporting the expelled lawmakers chanted &ldquo;<em>shame on you</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>fascists!</em>&rdquo; from the House gallery after the votes were counted. At least 20 people reportedly staged a demonstration described as a &ldquo;<em>die-in</em>&rdquo; outside the chamber doors.</p>

<p>Pearson branded the expulsion decision the &ldquo;<em>erosion of democracy in the state legislature,</em>&rdquo; vowing that &ldquo;<em>we will never quit.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two ousted lawmakers, who are both black, also pointed out that their white colleague had been spared, alleging a &ldquo;<em>racial dynamic</em>&rdquo; was at play. Republican leaders denied those claims.</p>
<p>Johnson, who also took part in the protest, insists she did not use the bullhorn. All three Democrats also encouraged children, parents, and others who had supported them at the legislature to chant gun-control slogans as well.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in resolutions of expulsion being filed against the lawmakers for &ldquo;<em>knowingly and intentionally bring</em>[ing] <em>disorder and dishonor</em>&rdquo; to the legislature.</p>
<p>While the ousted officials admitted to breaching the code of conduct, many fellow Democrats argued their expulsion was unjustified.</p>
<p>President Biden's statement&nbsp;described the removal of the two lawmakers as &ldquo;<em>shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accused the Republicans of failing to meaningfully discuss the issue of gun violence, and claimed they were instead focusing on going after their Democratic colleagues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing will continue to call for peace and dialogue, Zhang Hanhui says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Western countries have no right to give instructions to China regarding its relations with Russia and its stance on the Ukraine conflict, Chinese Ambassador to Moscow Zhang Hanhui has said.</p>
<p>Zhang was asked about the US and its allies pressuring Beijing amid the fighting in Ukraine and claims that China is supporting Moscow during an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia on Friday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the Chinese side that created the Ukrainian crisis. China isn&rsquo;t a party to it and hasn&rsquo;t provided arms to any of the sides of the conflict. The West isn&rsquo;t in a position to give instructions to China, and even more so it doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to relay the responsibility on it,&rdquo;</em> he replied.</p>
<p>According to the ambassador, Beijing <em>&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have its own interests in the Ukrainian issue... it doesn&rsquo;t add fuel to the fire, doesn&rsquo;t seize the moment in order to benefit from the crisis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On the contrary, the Chinese authorities have been consistently calling for a political settlement since the fighting began in Ukraine more than a year ago, he pointed out.<em> &ldquo;We will continue to stand on the side of peace, dialogue and historical justice,</em>&rdquo; Zhang stated.</p>

<p>On the issue of China-Russia relations, the ambassador noted that President Xi Jinping had described strengthening ties with Moscow <em>&ldquo;a strategic choice&rdquo;</em> for Beijing during a visit to Russia last month. Xi said this was <em>&ldquo;based on fundamental interests and the general trend of world development,&rdquo;</em> adding that it could not be <em>&ldquo;changed or shaken by momentary events.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;History shows that the Chinese-Russian relations can cope with the challenges of a changing international environment&rdquo;</em> as the neighbors have found <em>&ldquo;the path of proper coexistence,&rdquo;</em> said the president.</p>
<p>Zhang also spoke about attempts by <em>&ldquo;some countries&rdquo;</em> to use the Taiwan issue to <em>&ldquo;gain dividends&rdquo;</em> in its relations with China against the backdrop of the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The essence of the Taiwanese and Ukrainian problems are quite different. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and this issue is purely an internal affairs [matter] of the Chinese state... which doesn&rsquo;t accept any external interference,&rdquo;</em> the diplomat explained.</p>

<p>Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, but never officially declared independence from China. Beijing considers the island to be a part of its territory and strongly opposes contacts between Taipei and Washington, which supports the Taiwanese push for sovereignty and promises to protect the island militarily.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Top diplomats from Tehran and Riyadh met in Beijing on Thursday to reestablish contacts between the longtime rivals</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>CIA Director William Burns has told Saudi officials that the United States was caught off guard, after the kingdom agreed to a normalization deal with Iran brokered by China, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><strong></strong>During an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia this week, Burns <em>&ldquo;expressed frustration&rdquo;</em> with Riyadh and said Washington <em>&ldquo;felt blindsided&rdquo;</em> by its renewed diplomacy with both Iran and Syria, multiple unnamed sources <a href="https://archive.is/hY6ze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Journal on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia held talks in the Chinese capital on Thursday, where they discussed a number of issues related to the new initiative, including reopening embassies in both countries, designating ambassadors, and even a visit to Riyadh by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.</p>

<p>After years of strife as regional adversaries, Tehran and Riyadh concluded the normalization pact on March 10 following secret talks mediated by Beijing, agreeing to resume formal diplomatic relations after they cut ties in 2016. The deal marked a major diplomatic achievement for China and a significant shakeup&nbsp;in the geopolitics of the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Since the agreement was announced, top diplomats from Saudi Arabia and Iran have spoken on the phone at least three times, and hope to reach compromises on several outstanding issues &ndash; namely the war in Yemen, which has raged on for more than eight years and left hundreds of thousands dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Tehran is also working to reestablish contacts with the United Arab Emirates, another Gulf monarchy long at odds with the Islamic Republic. Earlier this week, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri said his country had appointed an ambassador to Abu Dhabi for the first time in nearly a decade. Riyadh is also reportedly seeking to reach a similar understanding with Syria, and hopes to invite President Bashar al-Assad for a visit later this year, according to Reuters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the White House has welcomed the new diplomacy in public, Burns&rsquo; reported complaints to Saudi officials this week could highlight concerns over Beijing&rsquo;s growing influence in the region. Tensions between Riyadh and Washington have also been on the rise since last year, when OPEC+, a group of major oil exporters led by Saudi Arabia, opted to slash production. The move reportedly <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/19/opec-cut-saudi-arabia-biden-admin-public-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angered</a>&rdquo;</em> President Joe Biden, who claimed the cut would benefit Russia, another large energy exporter.</p>

            <p>A leaked trove of classified documents outlining American and NATO war planning in Ukraine has sparked a US military investigation, the New York Times has reported. The briefing presentation slides, some marked <em>&ldquo;top secret,&rdquo;</em> show assessed troop strengths, timelines for arms shipments and ammunition expenditures, among other data.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The files appeared on social media earlier this week, and while the source remains unclear, the leaks have set off alarms in the Pentagon, which has launched a probe to determine how the documents were obtained, the NYT&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.ph/Hpx18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are aware of the reports of social media posts and the department is reviewing the matter,&rdquo;</em> Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told the outlet.</p>
<p>Officials said they are working to have the material removed from the internet, but had not succeeded as of Thursday night.</p>

<p>One of the documents marked <em>&ldquo;top secret&rdquo;</em> provides the <em>&ldquo;Status of the Conflict as of 1 Mar.,&rdquo;</em> suggesting the slides are several weeks old. Though they do not describe any specific battle plans, the files offer a glimpse into US intelligence assessments for Russian and Ukrainian troop levels, timetables for training and equipment deliveries, weather data, as well as ammunition expenditures &ndash; including for the US-supplied HIMARS platform. The Pentagon has not previously disclosed the rate at which Ukrainian forces are using munitions for the weapon.</p>
<p>Some of the documents appear to have been altered, with multiple different versions circulating online showing wildly varying estimates for losses on both sides of the conflict.</p>
<p>Another file lists 12 new Ukrainian combat brigades &ndash; which are usually made up of 4,000 to 5,000 troops &ndash; noting that the US and NATO bloc are training and supplying nine of them. Of those, the document states that six would be ready by the end of March, and the remaining three by April 30.</p>
<p>If genuine the documents represent one of the most significant intelligence breaches since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and come as Kiev is reportedly preparing a major counter-offensive against Russian forces. One of the documents shows two possible routes into the Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. It is unclear when the counter-attacks are set to begin, but Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov recently claimed that the two sides would fight a <em>&ldquo;final&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;decisive battle&rdquo;</em> sometime in the spring.</p>

                            <p><strong>Washington has reportedly pushed back against efforts by allies to give Kiev a clear path to joining the Western military bloc</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration has reportedly opposed efforts by some European&nbsp;countries to give Ukraine a clear <em>&ldquo;roadmap&rdquo;</em> for joining NATO, instead urging partners to focus on providing short-term aid to Kiev.</p>
<p>The US is siding with Germany and Hungary, by resisting efforts from Poland and the Baltic states to offer Ukraine deeper ties with NATO and clear support for its future membership in the Western military bloc, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c37ed22d-e0e4-4b03-972e-c56af8a36d2ehttps://www.ft.com/content/c37ed22d-e0e4-4b03-972e-c56af8a36d2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a> reported on Wednesday, citing four unidentified officials involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p>The issue has been under debate this week at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, where the groundwork is being laid for the bloc&rsquo;s leaders&rsquo; summit, which is scheduled for July in Vilnius, Lithuania. Although NATO&rsquo;s 31 members agree that membership can&rsquo;t be offered to Ukraine in the short term &ndash; nor can it be seriously discussed amid the former Soviet republic&rsquo;s current conflict with Russia &ndash; this week&rsquo;s talks have exposed a clear divide over the group&rsquo;s vision for Kiev&rsquo;s postwar status, the FT said.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has warned that he will only attend the summit in Vilnius if he&rsquo;s offered clear steps for Kiev&rsquo;s ascension to NATO, such as security guarantees and deeper collaboration with the alliance. Bloc members agreed in 2008 that Ukraine would be allowed to join NATO at some point. Back then, the US was pushing&nbsp;to give Kiev a clear timetable and an action plan for membership, the FT reported, but France and Germany resisted, citing&nbsp;concerns that such a step would provoke Russia.</p>
<p>Diplomats attending this week&rsquo;s talks haven&rsquo;t been able to reach agreement on what Ukraine should be offered. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got several weeks of hard negotiations ahead to close those gaps and craft a political outcome,&rdquo;</em> one official said. However, another noted, <em>&ldquo;The road [to Vilnius] is rocky.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Washington is concerned that deepening the alliance&rsquo;s ties with Ukraine at this juncture would feed into Russian claims that the current crisis is a conflict between Moscow and NATO, the FT said. It also might spur Russia to escalate the conflict, possibly by deploying nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Russian officials have claimed that the US and its NATO allies promised after the Soviet Union&rsquo;s collapse not to expand the bloc into Eastern Europe. Since then, the alliance has added 15 new members, all of which were former Soviet republics or part of Warsaw Pact nations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Donald Trump was to blame for the deadly 2021 withdrawal from Kabul, President Joe Biden’s administration claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Over&nbsp;a year and a half since&nbsp;the end of America&rsquo;s longest-ever war, President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration has attributed the chaos and deadly violence that arose during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;President Biden&rsquo;s choices for how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor,&rdquo;</em> the White House said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12-page report</a> released on Wednesday. Biden inherited the smallest US troop presence in Afghanistan since 2001, as well as an agreement by Trump to withdraw all of those forces by May 2021. The previous administration provided no plans for conducting the exit, the report said.</p>
<p>The report essentially acknowledged no mistakes by the administration, although one <em>&ldquo;lesson learned&rdquo;</em> was to prioritize earlier evacuations when faced with a <em>&ldquo;degrading security situation.&rdquo;</em> White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that those lessons had already been applied in Ukraine and Ethiopia, adding that such decisions are difficult because the administration must strike the right balance between getting its people out quickly enough and trying to avoid undermining the host government.</p>

<p>Kirby declined to acknowledge any regrets by Biden about his own decisions, saying the president would have started the evacuation sooner if military and intelligence agency assessments had been more prescient.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No agency predicted a Taliban takeover in nine days,&rdquo;</em> he said.<em> &ldquo;No agency predicted the rapid fleeing of President [Ashraf] Ghani ... And no agency predicted that the more than 300,000 trained and equipped Afghan national security and defense forces would fail to fight for their country, especially after 20 years of American support.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The report noted that Biden trusted the judgment of US military commanders on the ground to prioritize protection of their troops. Senior officers assured the president that they had sufficient resources to mitigate threats, including possible attacks by the ISIS-K terrorist group. An ISIS-K bombing on August 26 at the Kabul airport killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghans.</p>
<p>Three days later, a US drone strike killed ten Afghan civilians, including seven children, after American forces mistakenly identified an aid worker as a potential ISIS-K bomber. The White House report made no mention of the fact that military leaders concealed what they knew about the errant strike for days.</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter who will be fired as a result of the blunders in Afghanistan, Kirby said, <em>&ldquo;This document and this effort isn&rsquo;t about accountability today, it&rsquo;s about understanding.&rdquo;</em> He added, <em>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s saying that everything was perfect, but there&rsquo;s a lot that went right,&rdquo;</em> including the evacuation of 124,000 people and the settling of 100,000 Afghan allies in the US.</p>

                            <p><strong>IDF warplanes bombed the Palestinian city in “revenge” for rockets fired from Lebanon</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Israeli planes began bombing Gaza in the early hours of Friday, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Palestinian group Hamas for Thursday&rsquo;s rocket attack from Lebanese territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The IDF is currently striking in Gaza,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1644087964543352833">tweeted</a> at 12:21 am local time.</p>
<p>Palestinian media outlets reported that Hamas air defenses have been activated. There were no reports of casualties so far. Videos shared on social media showed explosions lighting up the night.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ar" dir="rtl">مستوطنون غلاف غزة يلتقطون صورا لغزة وهي تقصف الآن من قبل الطيران الحربي الإسرائيلي 🇵🇸 <a href="https://t.co/McliQFW4SK">pic.twitter.com/McliQFW4SK</a></p>&mdash; غزة الآن - Gaza Now (@GazaNownews) <a href="https://twitter.com/GazaNownews/status/1644091510072147975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p><em>&ldquo;We will strike our enemies and they will pay the price for any act of aggression,&rdquo;</em> Netanyahu said on Thursday, after some 34 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon. No one took responsibility for the attack, but the IDF blamed Hamas, a militant Palestinian group headquartered in Gaza.</p>
<p>Israeli media called the attack the most serious escalation since 2006, when Israel attempted to dislodge Hezbollah from southern Lebanon. That war is widely considered a Hezbollah victory.</p>

            <script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?22" data-telegram-post="BellumActaNews/93497" data-width="100%"></script>
    

<p>According to local media, Hamas and Hezbollah have placed their long-range rockets on high alert, and may strike at central Israel in response to the IDF bombing.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whom Netanyahu fired last week but reinstated after public backlash, has instructed the IDF to prepare for <em>&ldquo;all possible options of retaliation.&rdquo;</em> All IDF personnel were reportedly recalled from leave and the units near the border with Lebanon placed on high alert on Thursday.</p>
<p>Media outlets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have speculated that a strike on Gaza was certain, while another operation in Lebanon was highly likely.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Israeli riot police arrested hundreds of Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, disrupting services during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Some Palestinians had flocked to the mosque after reports that Israeli settlers were planning to ritually sacrifice a goat there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous clashes at al-Aqsa, in May 2021, triggered an <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/524366-israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/">11-day conflict</a> between Israel and Hamas. It eventually ended in a ceasefire mediated by Egypt.</p>
<p>Just last week, Netanyahu faced mass protests organized by the liberal opposition, which called for his resignation over the proposed overhaul of Israel&rsquo;s supreme court.</p>

                            <p><strong>The prime minister blamed Palestinian groups for a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The enemies of Israel will &ldquo;<em>pay a price</em>&rdquo; regardless of internal disagreements over the government&rsquo;s judicial overhaul, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised in an emergency cabinet meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We will strike our enemies and they will pay the price for any act of aggression</em>,&rdquo; the PM said after 34 rockets were fired at Israel from Lebanon during the Jewish holiday of Passover, marking what Israeli media outlets have called the most serious escalation between Lebanon and Israel since the&nbsp; 2006 war.</p>
<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told reporters Hamas was the guilty party, adding that Lebanon was also &ldquo;<em>responsible for any attack from its territory.</em>&rdquo; Neither Hamas nor Beirut have commented on the allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who was fired by Netanyahu last week only to be reinstated after massive protests, has reportedly instructed the military to prepare &ldquo;<em>all possible options of retaliation for the rocket attack</em>&rdquo; and present them to the cabinet.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Two unnamed Israeli officials told Axios that while a &ldquo;<em>very strong</em>&rdquo; response against Hamas in Gaza was certain, the IDF&rsquo;s actions in Lebanon were less so, as the government wants to avoid total war. The IDF was reportedly already bombing Gaza as of Thursday night.</p>
<p>However, written instructions obtained by the outlet and confirmed by two Israeli ambassadors indicate the Israeli Foreign Ministry has instructed all ambassadors to inform their host countries that Israel plans to strike back at Lebanon. In addition to impressing upon host countries&rsquo; foreign ministries that &ldquo;<em>Israel will take the necessary steps to defend itself</em>,&rdquo; ambassadors were also given orders to pressure host countries into issuing statements condemning the rockets from Lebanon.</p>
<p>Continuing to address his cabinet on Thursday, Netanyahu said &ldquo;<em>Israel is maintaining the status quo at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem</em>,&rdquo; vowing to &ldquo;<em>act against anybody who uses violence at the Temple Mount</em>.&rdquo; Heavily-armed police descended upon the al-Aqsa mosque earlier this week with tear gas and sound bombs, arresting hundreds of Palestinians as they observed the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims had rushed to defend the site after Israeli settlers announced the ritual slaughter of a goat at the holy site, a violation of Israeli law that the authorities have tended to overlook.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>An out-of-control angry bird injured his owner during a cockfight in Mexico</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A cockfight in the central-western Mexican city of Colima turned into a bloodbath after a battle rooster turned against his master, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Footage from the cockpit, circulating online, shows two men pitting their roosters against one another for a fight. The birds appear to be wearing artificial spurs, enabling them to deliver maximum damage to their opponent.</p>
<p>One of the birds, however, decided to attack its master instead of the rival rooster, scoring multiple hits to his leg in a matter of seconds. The rooster owner eventually managed to grab his cock, with the opposing bird seizing the opportunity to deliver a few pecks on it.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Imágenes Sensibles!! En Villa De Álvarez Colima, en medio de una pelea de gallos, el colorado atacó a su amarrador‼️<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gallo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gallo</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SalioMuyGallo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SalioMuyGallo</a></p>&mdash; Anonymous México ❁ (@_AnonymousMx) <a href="https://twitter.com/_AnonymousMx/status/1643064254357020673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
    

<p>The man also suffered an arm wound in the skirmish, yet it was not immediately clear which of the birds was responsible for it. The man then collapsed to the ground with blood pouring from his leg, as the cock had apparently penetrated a major vessel.</p>
<p>The cockfighting-watching crowd then rushed to bandage the man&rsquo;s leg, dragging him out of the cockpit. Additional, extremely graphic footage taken in the aftermath of the incident shows the man suffered at least three deep slashes to his leg.</p>
<p>Cockfighting remains legal &ndash; or, at least, tolerated &ndash; throughout most of Mexico, with the bouts routinely taking place during regional fairs and other celebrations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Democrats have taken aim at Clarence Thomas, alleging he failed to disclose two decades’ worth of luxury trips from a Republican donor</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Democrats in the US Congress are demanding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas face serious consequences up to and including removal from the bench, after a ProPublica investigation on Thursday claimed he had not disclosed decades&rsquo; worth of luxury gifts and trips from Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow.</p>
<p>New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for the justice&rsquo;s immediate impeachment less than 24 hours after the report&rsquo;s publication, denouncing Thomas&rsquo; &ldquo;<em>shocking - almost cartoonish</em>&rdquo; levels of &ldquo;<em>corruption</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>This is beyond party or partisanship</em>,&rdquo; she tweeted, warning that &ldquo;<em>barring some dramatic change, this is what [Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts&rsquo;] court will be known for: rank corruption, erosion of democracy, and the stripping of human rights.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senate Judiciary Committee chair Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, vowed his committee would act on the report, calling Thomas&rsquo; behavior &ldquo;<em>simply inconsistent with the ethical standards the American people expect of any public servant, let alone a Justice on the Supreme Court.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and fellow Judiciary Committee member and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined the outcry, demanding stricter ethics rules to govern the nation&rsquo;s highest court.</p>
<p>ProPublica&rsquo;s report details a relationship in which Crow, a billionaire Dallas businessman, paid for yearly vacations, travel, and lodging &ndash; including getaways at his own private lakeside resort nearly every summer and extensive travel aboard his private jet and yacht &ndash; for over 20 years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in total.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The extent and frequency of Crow&rsquo;s apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the US Supreme Court</em>,&rdquo; the report states, claiming his failure to disclose the &ldquo;<em>gifts</em>&rdquo; on his financial disclosures violates ethics laws requiring justices, judges, members of Congress, and federal officials to disclose most of the gifts they receive.</p>
<p>In a statement to ProPublica, Crow countered that Thomas was a friend and had never asked for any of the gifts or hospitality, adding that neither he nor anyone else present at the gatherings had ever discussed pending cases with the judge.</p>
<p>Thomas is generally considered the most conservative member of the Roberts Court, which leans heavily conservative overall following a trio of appointments by former president Donald Trump. While some Democrats, including AOC, have called for expanding the court beyond its traditional nine justices in the hope of neutralizing its conservative bent, a bipartisan commission created by President Joe Biden to study the feasibility of such a controversial measure stopped short of recommending it. Should Thomas be impeached, Biden would be called upon to appoint his replacement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Taipei has vowed not to comply after Chinese government orders inspections of ships around the self-governing island</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwan&rsquo;s maritime authority has refused to comply after China&rsquo;s government launched patrols in waters around the self-governing island and ordered that any ships in the region be stopped for inspections.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If the mainland side insists on taking one-sided actions, it will create obstacles to normal exchanges between the two sides,&rdquo;</em> the Taiwanese Maritime &amp; Port Bureau said in a <a href="https://www.motcmpb.gov.tw/Information/Detail/77644765-b312-43d6-a504-9674cbf3747b?NodeId=15&amp;SiteId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Thursday, following Beijing&rsquo;s announcement of patrols in the Taiwan Strait. <em>&ldquo;We will be forced to take corresponding measures. As a result, the mainland side must bear the responsibility for subsequent consequences, which is not what the two sides like.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The maritime authority filed a complaint with Chinese officials and called for shipping companies to ignore inspection orders in the Taiwan Strait. It also advised shippers to notify the Taiwanese coast guard if they receive such demands.</p>
<p>Beijing announced a three-day series of patrols in the region one day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen met in California with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other Washington lawmakers. Chinese officials vowed to take <em>&ldquo;strong and resolute measures&rdquo;</em> in response to the <em>&ldquo;egregiously wrong&rdquo;</em> meeting.</p>

<p>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province, and has vowed to reunify with the island &ndash; by force if necessary. Beijing has warned that US meddling in Chinese-Taiwanese affairs emboldens separatists and undermines China&rsquo;s sovereignty. After McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, traveled to Taipei last August, Beijing ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait and cut off defense and climate ties with the US.</p>
<p>Under its so-called <em>&lsquo;One China&rsquo;</em> policy, the US acknowledges &ndash; without endorsing &ndash; the Chinese government&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan. President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration has tried to downplay the significance of high-level meetings between US and Taiwanese politicians, saying it opposes <em>&ldquo;any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>US Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, reacted to the Chinese patrols by saying intimidation is <em>&ldquo;what they do.&rdquo;</em> He added that any effort by Beijing to block the Taiwan Strait would be unacceptable and unsustainable. <em>&ldquo;They have certain plans. Whether they carry those out, I don&rsquo;t know. But I think that would be a very unfortunate mistake on the part of the Chinese Communist Party.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Report follows another which condemned UK capital's police force as being “institutionally racist”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Black girls and teenagers are close to three-times more likely to be strip-searched by London&rsquo;s Met Police if suspected of a crime compared to their white counterparts, data analyzed by Liberty Investigates suggests.</p>
<p>The findings of the study, which was published by UK daily The Guardian, showed that between 2017 and 2022, 110 female children and teenagers were strip-searched by London&rsquo;s police police force, according to information obtained through freedom of information requests &ndash; with 47% of the strip-searches being performed on black girls.</p>
<p>The data separates instances which are less invasive and those during which a subject&rsquo;s private body parts are revealed. In both, black girls were far more likely to be searched.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Although the government remains in denial on this issue, it is also compelling evidence of blatant racist discrimination,&rdquo;</em> said Labour MP Diane Abbott of the study. <em>&ldquo;Especially as we know that in most cases there is no evidence of any criminal activity at all.&rdquo;</em> Abbott also called for the Met Police to be <em>&ldquo;disbanded and re-established on a much better basis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A spokesperson for the London police force said last month that, <em>&ldquo;We fully acknowledge that we have overused this type of search.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We have been making significant efforts to ensure that the use of this tactic is absolutely appropriate in all circumstances and that our approach puts the child at the heart of decision making.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The study follows another official report released in March which showed that black children as a whole were up to 11 times more likely to be subjected to a strip-search in England and Wales, per data collected by the Children's Commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza.</p>
<p>That report found that there were at least 2,847 instances of children being strip-searched pre-arrest under police &lsquo;stop and search&rsquo; powers. 38% of these children were black, despite making up just 5.9% of the total population. White children, by comparison, made up 42% of the searches and 74% of the population.</p>
<p>This, in turn, followed another report from March which criticized the Met Police for being <em>&ldquo;institutionally racist, sexist and homophobic.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Royal Mail workers have been involved in prolonged industrial action since last year over low pay and unsatisfactory conditions</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The UK&rsquo;s postal service, Royal Mail, has issued an apology after employees on strike were told they would receive substantial raises in what turned out to be an April Fools&rsquo; prank.</p>
<p>A poster displayed to workers on April 1 at a Royal Mail branch in Gloucester, England explained that the company and the Communication Workers Union had <em>&ldquo;reached an agreement&rdquo;</em> which would bring an end to strikes that have caused several months worth of disruptions within the UK&rsquo;s mail delivery system.</p>
<p>The poster stated that staff members would receive an 11% pay increase, backdated by 12 months, as well as several other concessions. It also informed them that they were encouraged to distribute the message on social media, prompting it to be spread widely among Royal Mail employees around the UK.</p>
<p>However, what had initially appeared to be a breakthrough in talks between the union representing workers and Royal Mail heads quickly devolved into antipathy when people found out that the letter was little more than a <em>&ldquo;tone-deaf&rdquo;</em> prank.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We apologize for any upset caused by this misjudged April Fools&rsquo; joke at one of our delivery offices,&rdquo;</em> Royal Mail said in a statement this week. <em>&ldquo;The poster was removed and the local manager has apologized.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Throughout the postal workers&rsquo; strike, Royal Mail workplaces have seen managers engaging in unprecedented levels of intimidation against postal workers,&rdquo;</em> the Communication Workers Union said in a statement earlier this week. <em>&ldquo;For many employees, the workplace is now a completely toxic environment where nasty, tone-deaf &lsquo;jokes&rsquo; such as these are considered culturally acceptable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It added that some workers represented by the union had been dismissed from their positions for <em>&ldquo;far less than this joke.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Royal Mail workers have been involved in prolonged protests due to complaints about low pay and unsatisfactory working conditions. The dispute has led to 18 days of strikes so far, which included walkouts during the busy Christmas period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>An attorney representing one of the “insurrection” defendants has claimed that 40 government agents were embedded among protesters</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Law enforcement agencies had at least 40 undercover informants embedded among the protesters alleging election fraud at the January 2021 US Capitol breach, a lawyer for one of the riot defendants has claimed.</p>
<p>Government officials have admitted that eight FBI informants were operating within the Proud Boys conservative activist group during the January 6 Capitol riot, defense lawyer Roger Roots said on Wednesday in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/636497598/Dominic-Pezzola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">court filing</a>. Roots, who represents Proud Boys member Dominic Pezzola, claimed that US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) had 19 informants among the protesters, while Washington&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police Department had 13 on site.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The federal prosecutors in this case are refusing to disclose information regarding these non-FBI informants,&rdquo;</em> Roots said in the US District Court filing. <em>&ldquo;The existence and likely conduct of these confidential human sources is almost certainly exculpatory for Pezzola.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>More than 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes for their alleged roles in the Capitol riot, which supporters of President Joe Biden have touted as a racially motivated <em>&ldquo;insurrection&rdquo;</em> aimed at blocking the peaceful transfer of power after former President Donald Trump&rsquo;s election defeat. Pezzola is standing trial in Washington, along with former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio and several other members of the activist group, for allegedly conspiring to disrupt certification of Biden&rsquo;s election victory.</p>
<p>Roots said some of the informants marched with the protesters and helped to instigate the Capitol breach. He asked the court to force the government to <em>&ldquo;reveal all informants, undercover operatives and other confidential human sources relating to the events of January 6.&rdquo;</em> The lawyer added that the defense&rsquo;s trial strategy would have been different if it had been aware of the <em>&ldquo;scope and scale&rdquo;</em> of the undercover government operations at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Roots also requested the court&rsquo;s permission to subpoena Ray Epps, the protester seen on video urging Trump supporters to go into the Capitol. Epps has denied being a government informant. Critics of the federal crackdown on alleged rioters have questioned why Epps hasn&rsquo;t been arrested for his role in the incident. He is being <em>&ldquo;suspiciously protected from prosecution by the government,&rdquo;</em> Roots said.</p>

<p>Prosecutors revealed last month that a woman whom Tarrio&rsquo;s lawyer planned to call as a witness had worked as an FBI informant.

<p>&ldquo;<em>On the Ukraine crisis, China upholds an objective and just position. We have been advocating a political settlement of the crisis and working for talks for peace</em>,&rdquo; she explained, claiming that this was a strategy &ldquo;<em>supported by the vast majority of countries in the world</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned China to curtail its &ldquo;growing alignment&rdquo; with Moscow, accusing Beijing of &ldquo;<em>prop[ping] up Russia&rsquo;s economy</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>refus[ing] to condemn Russia&rsquo;s aggression</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supplying weapons to NATO&rsquo;s arch-nemesis, Stoltenberg added, &ldquo;<em>would be a historic mistake, with profound implications.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beijing has repeatedly denied having any plans to provide lethal aid to Russia, which has likewise denied reports that it has requested military equipment from the Chinese.</p>
<p>The two nations have grown closer over the past year, vowing to &ldquo;<em>further deepen mutual military trust</em>&rdquo; after last month&rsquo;s meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the Kremlin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Putin more recently clarified that there was no &ldquo;<em>military alliance with China</em>&rdquo; on the horizon, merely &ldquo;<em>cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction</em>.&rdquo; The West, he argued, was merely projecting its fantasy of a new axis similar to the fascist enemy of World War II onto its chief geopolitical rivals.</p>
<p>The US has nevertheless sanctioned several Chinese companies for allegedly supplying parts used in Iranian drones, which Washington claims are being used by Russia in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Treasury announced new sanctions on five Chinese companies and one individual said to be &ldquo;<em>responsible for the sale and shipment of thousands of aerospace components</em>&rdquo; to Iran, including parts that could be used to make drones. Iran, too, has denied providing weapons to Russia for use in the Ukrainian conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing and its partners reportedly hope to challenge the US’ dominance of the global communications infrastructure</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>China&rsquo;s largest telecom firms are working on a massive undersea telecommunications cable network aimed at challenging the US&rsquo; dominance in operating global internet infrastructure, four people involved with the project told Reuters on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China Telecom, China Mobile Limited and China Unicom are in the planning stages of what is expected to be a $500-million undersea fiber optic project connecting Asia with the Middle East and Europe, the sources said. The sprawling network, known as EMA (Europe-Middle East-Asia), is reportedly intended to compete with another cable system currently under construction by US firm SubCom LLC called SeaMeWe-6 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-6).</p>
<p>Chinese firm HMN Tech (formerly Huawei Marine Networks) was initially selected in 2020 to manufacture the cable for SeaMeWe-6 by a consortium that included the Chinese telecoms now working on EMA. However, a sustained US pressure campaign that included millions of dollars in &ldquo;<em>training grants</em>&rdquo; to foreign telecoms in return for switching their votes ultimately pushed the contract to HMN&rsquo;s US competitor last year, despite significantly higher costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three Chinese telecoms have reportedly signed agreements with telecoms in France, Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, with further deals in the works elsewhere in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The consortium hopes to bring EMA online by the end of 2025, the sources told Reuters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advantages of such a project for China are obvious, one source told Reuters &ndash; a faster connection between China, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world not under US control gives Beijing an insurance policy should they be cut off from US-controlled networks. Washington has been campaigning for years to convince allies to exclude Chinese companies from future infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>However, Reuters&rsquo; sources said they fear the plan presages a growing division of global internet infrastructure into what a researcher for military-industrial think tank RAND Corporation described as &ldquo;<em>a US-led internet and a Chinese-led internet ecosystem</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The more the US and Chinese disengage from each other in the information technology domain, the more difficult it becomes to carry out global commerce and basic functions</em>,&rdquo; RAND&rsquo;s Timothy Heath told Reuters, warning that forcing third countries to choose between the two &ldquo;<em>sides</em>&rdquo; would make technologies like GPS satellites and online banking much less reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Antonia Hmaidi, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies, agreed that splitting global internet traffic between two superpowers would significantly increase the likelihood of those superpowers manipulating and spying on data, with a general decline in quality and quantity of service until &ldquo;<em>suddenly the whole fabric of the internet doesn&rsquo;t work as it was intended.</em>&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Estimates suggest hay fever costs the Japanese economy $1.68 billion per day</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called for immediate government action to counter a hay fever epidemic, afflicting tens of millions of people nationwide, after the pollen count surged in some areas to the highest levels seen in a decade.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hay fever is an issue that can be said to be a social problem in our country,&rdquo;</em> Kishida said this week, as reported by the Japanese daily Mainichi. He added that meetings of relevant ministers will be held <em>&ldquo;to share information and work on effective countermeasures,&rdquo;</em> as <em>&ldquo;we want to achieve results.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allergy affects around 40% of the Japanese population and has been blamed for a downturn in spending and productivity in the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy. A 2020 study of Japanese sufferers of the malady suggested that about 80% admitted to a loss of productivity as a result of their symptoms, which include sneezing and congestion.</p>
<p>Another study by electronics giant Panasonic estimated that hay fever contributed to a daily economic loss of 221.5 billion yen ($1.68 billion).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hay fever is said to be a national disease,&rdquo;</em> said Taro Yamada of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party this week. <em>&ldquo;If a system that plays the role of a command post is created and countermeasures are taken, it will be a popular policy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Yamada added that <em>&ldquo;the prime minister&rsquo;s name will go down in history&rdquo;</em> if hay fever is brought under control.</p>
<p>Unseasonably warm weather in Japan is thought to have exacerbated the situation for sufferers who are facing the highest pollen levels recorded in a decade in Tokyo and 11 other prefectures. Pollen, a fine powder emitted by plants during their reproductive cycles, is the root cause of hay fever.</p>
<p>Some medical dispensaries have recorded a doubling in sales of therapeutic treatments such as antihistamines compared to the same period of 2022, with some employers providing workers with <em>&ldquo;hay fever allowances&rdquo;</em> to spend on treatments and GP visits.</p>
<p>The near-ubiquity of hay fever in Japan is blamed on a post-war reforestation program which was implemented to aid the country&rsquo;s construction industry. However, the large-scale importation of raw materials in the 1970s and 1980s led to cedar and cypress trees growing into huge forests, emitting exponentially larger levels of pollen annually.</p>
<p>Kishida&rsquo;s proposal to alleviate hay fever symptoms among the Japanese populace includes implementing a logging program to remove cedar and cypress trees and to implement a reforestation plan with trees less associated with pollen emission.</p>
<p>Tetsuro Nomura, who heads the country&rsquo;s Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, has also proposed expanded production of so-called <em>&ldquo;cedar pollen allergy-relieving rice&rdquo;</em> which is thought to help alleviate hay fever symptoms in those who consume it, according to Mainichi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The former French president confirmed that France and the EU are “participants” in the Ukraine conflict</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Francois Hollande has confirmed that the European Union and France are directly participating in the armed conflict in Ukraine, despite Paris officially denying such claims.</p>
<p>The former French president unwittingly spoke at length about the situation in Ukraine with Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus, who were pretending to be former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Hollande declared that he was on Kiev&rsquo;s side and <em>&ldquo;fully supports Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> adding that <em>&ldquo;wherever I can speak, I always ask to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He admitted to &lsquo;Poroshenko&rsquo; that the EU and France are <em>&ldquo;participants&rdquo;</em> in the conflict but explained that they don&rsquo;t want to openly declare their involvement, fearing that Russia could retaliate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to become a warring side in the sense that Russia could use their support as an excuse to take action against a neighboring European country and drag the world into a war that will go beyond Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Hollande said.</p>
<p>The former president predicted that the outcome of the Ukrainian conflict would shape the new world power balance and that <em>&ldquo;if Ukraine wins, which is something I wholeheartedly want, then it would serve as a rebuff to authoritarian regimes&rdquo;</em> such as China, Iran and Turkey.</p>
<p>Hollande insisted that there could be no negotiations at the moment and that European leaders should avoid even mentioning the idea until Ukraine pushes Russian forces out of the territories Kiev claims as its own and so long as the Ukrainian people still wish to fight to the last.</p>

<p>He also commented on the Minsk accords, which were signed in 2014 by Russia, France and Germany as a roadmap to establishing peace in Ukraine after tensions erupted in the country following the armed Maidan coup that ousted President Viktor Yanukovich. Hollande admitted that the real purpose of the accords was to buy time to arm and train Ukraine&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former French leader also noted Poroshenko&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;key role&rdquo;</em> in ousting Yanukovich and pushing Ukraine towards the EU. He said that, if Poroshenko hadn&rsquo;t come to Paris in 2013, there <em>&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t have been a Maidan and you wouldn&rsquo;t have achieved your victory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hollande is the latest Western official to have been duped by the Russian pranksters, admitting things they avoid saying publicly. Last month, the pair had a conversation with former UK foreign secretary William Hague, who stated that the West&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;ideal&rdquo;</em> scenario was a military coup in Russia that would oust Putin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The French president reportedly tried to “push” China to side against Russia in Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was unmoved by the rhetoric of his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on the conflict in Ukraine, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-xi-jinping-china-russia-war-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Thursday. Paris has tried both appeals and threats in order to pressure Beijing into denouncing Moscow, apparently to little effect.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table,&rdquo;</em> Macron told Xi. Earlier, he <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/574298-macron-xi-visit-ukraine/">told French reporters</a> that <em>&ldquo;anyone helping the aggressor would be an accomplice in breach of international law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Xi responded by saying China was <em>&ldquo;willing to jointly appeal with France to the international community to remain rational and calm,&rdquo;</em> and repeated Beijing&rsquo;s position on the conflict.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Peace talks should be resumed as soon as possible, taking into account the reasonable security concerns of all sides with reference to the UN Charter&hellip; seeking political resolution and constructing a balanced, effective and sustainable European security framework,&rdquo;</em> he told reporters at the Great Hall of the People.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Macron broke protocol by speaking almost twice as long as Xi, and veered into demands that China condemn <em>&ldquo;the war waged by Russia against Ukraine.&rdquo;</em> According to Politico, Xi <em>&ldquo;looked impatient and annoyed&rdquo;</em> as Macron spoke, and <em>&ldquo;heaved several deep sighs&rdquo;</em> when Ukraine came up.</p>

<p>The French president announced a trip to China just after Xi spent three days in Moscow, signing a <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573383-putin-xi-agreements-cooperation/">series of agreements</a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At one point, the smiling Chinese leader was overheard telling Putin that their two countries were driving change the world hadn&rsquo;t seen in over a century.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Meanwhile, problems piled up at home for Macron. A sanitation workers&rsquo; strike left Paris buried in uncollected garbage, while mass protests against retirement reform &ndash; which Macron imposed by decree, bypassing the parliament &ndash; continued across France. New <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/574257-marine-lepen-macron-poll/">polls</a> showed his rival Marine Le Pen becoming more popular.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Macron is scheduled to travel with Xi to Guangzhou on Friday for more talks and a private dinner. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whom Macron brought along to <em>&ldquo;showcase European unity,&rdquo;</em> met with Xi on Thursday but was not included in many of the bilateral meetings.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Appearing at a press conference by herself on Thursday evening, Von der Leyen repeated Brussels&rsquo; talking points without much regard for her hosts. She brought up Taiwan, saying that any threat of force to change its status was <em>&ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo;</em> The EU official also argued that providing weapons to Russia would <em>&ldquo;significantly harm the relationship between the EU and China,&rdquo;</em> and that Brussels expects Beijing to <em>&ldquo;play its role and promote a just peace, one that respects Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial sovereignty.&rdquo;</em><strong><br /></strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The lack of condemnation of the St. Petersburg blast hints that sometimes terrorism is considered acceptable</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Apparently terrorism and murdering reporters get a free pass if the Western establishment doesn&rsquo;t like the target&rsquo;s profile &ndash; or if the perpetrator risks being linked to an ally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The radio silence from the West is deafening in the wake of the murder of military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a cafe in St. Petersburg. Tatarsky was killed after being handed a statue by a young woman, Darya Trepova, that subsequently blew up the entire venue.</p>
<p>For all of the Western officials&rsquo; differences with Russia, can they really not at least bring themselves to condemn a blatant act of terrorism in the middle of a major city center? We&rsquo;re talking here about the same folks who spent two decades kicking down doors around the world under the guise of fighting a &ldquo;<em>Global War on Terrorism.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Just a few years ago, cartoonists and writers for the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were gunned down in broad daylight at their Paris office by jihadists who objected to the publication&rsquo;s portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. Western leaders roundly condemned that terrorist act, standing firmly on the principle that you couldn&rsquo;t just go around murdering people who conveyed thoughts and views that you didn&rsquo;t like. Many of these leaders even traveled to Paris to march alongside a massive crowd in defense of freedom of expression and the press.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, however, they can&rsquo;t even bother to muster the most meager defense of the same principles in the wake of Tatarsky&rsquo;s murder in an attack that investigators claim is <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/574068-kiev-behind-murder-russian-blogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems that whenever there&rsquo;s any alleged involvement of Ukraine, the West conveniently turns a blind eye. The automobile explosion that killed Russian journalist and activist, Darya Dugina, near Moscow comes to mind. &ldquo;<em>American officials said they were not aware of the plan ahead of time for the attack that killed Daria Dugina and that they had admonished Ukraine over it,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-dugina-assassination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> the New York Times last October.&nbsp;Similarly, the Washington Post <a href="https://archive.is/9rZwL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> this week that the &ldquo;<em>unwritten rule&rdquo;</em> among Western officials is <em>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk about Nord Stream&rdquo;</em> &ndash; the pipeline network carrying gas from Russia to Europe that was mysteriously blown up last year &ndash; since they &ldquo;<em>would rather not have to deal with the possibility that Ukraine or its allies were involved.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is the &ldquo;Mirotvorets&rdquo; list of journalists and activists maintained by Kiev-based NGO, the Mirotvorets Center, which names people &ldquo;<em>whose actions have signs of crimes against the national security of Ukraine, peace, human security, and the international law.</em>&rdquo; It has yet to either be <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ukrainian-digital-blacklist-14fec836753f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down</a> by the Ukrainian government or denounced by Western allies, despite a 2017 United Nations report on human rights in Ukraine urging Ukrainian authorities to address it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acts of terrorism and affronts to free speech are clearly in the eye of the Western beholder, which would explain why much of the media rhetoric focuses on Tatarsky&rsquo;s pro-Russia stance. The void left by the lack of official reaction from Western officials is being filled with Western press articles focusing on the Ukrainian-born blogger&rsquo;s prior involvement with Russian-backed separatist forces in 2014 in the Donbass. There, he got his start in covering events through his Telegram channel, which grew to become wildly popular, with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/03/europe/vladlen-tatarsky-russian-blogger-killed-profile-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> noting his <em>&ldquo;ardent pro-war commentary.</em>&rdquo; But if prior military experience of some kind, and taking sides in one&rsquo;s coverage of armed conflict, was justification for murdering journalists, then every Western veteran who started a blog, and every opinion journalist, would be fair game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no shortage of Western outrage over the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi embassy in Istanbul a few years ago, despite his longstanding activism against the Saudi leadership. Why should the death of this Russian blogger be treated any differently?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bulgarian investigative journalist, Cristo Grozev, who was heavily featured in the Academy Award-winning feature documentary film about Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny, apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEO_7JrZUsQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thinks</a> that some people are just &ldquo;<em>legitimate targets&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; for terrorism, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1642706337523007490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argues</a> that the cafe may not have been a &ldquo;<em>purely civilian location.&rdquo;</em> Although it was previously owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russian private military enterprise, Wagner Group, that doesn&rsquo;t magically transform a dining establishment, which welcomes anyone right off the street in the middle of a major city, into some kind of a military base. If an American general walks into the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Pentagon City, Virginia, it doesn&rsquo;t suddenly turn the hotel or its bar into a legitimate military target for bombing by some entity that has a score to settle with Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what about every journalist who has been embedded as the guest of Western troops in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan and has promoted the talking points of their hosts while siding with their own country? Are they fair game for picking off now, too?</p>
<p>The prominent Washington Institute for the Study of War think tank, whose board members include American generals Jack Keane and David Petraeus, as well as Washington&rsquo;s former ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, previously and routinely <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/search/google/Tartarsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified</a> Tatarsky as a prominent Russian military blogger whose work they apparently considered worthy of informing their research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s an effort underway by some members of the Western establishment to reframe this egregious act of terrorism and murder as something trivial, all because the target was a Russian whose views they don&rsquo;t like &ndash; and that&rsquo;s an awfully slippery slope.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>France is counting on China to reason with Russia, its president said during a visit to Beijing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reiterated his calls for Beijing to serve as a mediator in the Ukraine conflict, during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Macron is visiting China following a recent meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table,&rdquo;</em> the French leader told his host ahead of their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.</p>
<p>The Chinese government criticized Moscow&rsquo;s decision to send troops into Ukraine in February last year, but agreed with its argument that NATO&rsquo;s expansion in Europe and a refusal to respect Russian red lines were at the core of the confrontation. Xi has urged Russia and Ukraine to negotiate.</p>
<p>The French leader also asked the Chinese president to put pressure on Russia over what he perceived to be an affront to nuclear non-proliferation rules. Moscow has announced its intention to store some of its naval nuclear weapons in Belarus, arguing that it would be no different to Washington&rsquo;s deployment of nukes in other nations, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>Xi said all countries should respect commitments not to use nuclear weapons and urged the international community to <em>&ldquo;refrain from any action that would lead to further deterioration of the crisis or even to it getting out of control.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry presented a general roadmap for resolving the Ukrainian conflict. Moscow said it would consider this but believed that some parts of the proposal were impossible to implement due to Kiev&rsquo;s uncompromising position. In March, Xi met with Putin in Moscow, and they were filmed saying warm goodbyes as their two-day encounter ended, with China&rsquo;s leader declaring that they were driving geopolitical change around the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beijing&rsquo;s 12-step peace plan was rejected by Washington, which criticized China for not condemning Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Xi of providing <em>&ldquo;diplomatic cover&rdquo;</em> for Russia when the Chinese leader visited Moscow last month. The top US diplomat warned other nations not to be <em>&ldquo;fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kiev currently has a legal ban in place on negotiating with Russia and is seeking to defeat its opponent on the battlefield. Moscow considers the hostilities in Ukraine to be part of a wider US proxy war against Russia. It believes that the Ukrainian government&rsquo;s foreign policy is being determined by Washington.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Israeli forces have reportedly retaliated with artillery shelling</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Air raid alarms sounded across northern Israel on Thursday afternoon amid reports of a rocket barrage fired from Lebanon. At least one projectile was intercepted by the Iron Dome system, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has confirmed.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s Magen David Adom rescue service said at least one person was lightly injured by shrapnel, while a woman was hurt while running for a bomb shelter. There were no immediate reports of material damage.</p>
<p>Shortly after the rocket attacks, the Israeli military shelled southern Lebanon with artillery, two Lebanese security sources told Reuters. They confirmed at least two rocket attacks on Israel had originated from the country.</p>

<p>A total of 30 rockets were launched during the attack, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported, citing initial assessments. At least five evaded air defenses, causing damage and injuries on the ground.</p>
<p>So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and the Lebanese army and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) have also not issued statements.</p>
<p>The rocket barrage comes shortly after the Lebanon-based Hezbollah promised to take <em>&ldquo;measures&rdquo;</em> over ongoing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Clashes recently erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, also known as the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem&nbsp;during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>However, a source close to Hezbollah told al-Arabiya that the group was not behind the barrage.<em> &ldquo;We have nothing to do with the rocket fire,&rdquo;</em> the source stated. A separate source claimed to the network that unspecified<em> &ldquo;Palestinian factions&rdquo;</em> were behind the incident.</p>
<p>Heavily armed Israeli security forces entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Wednesday, confronting hundreds of Palestinian youths who had barricaded themselves inside one of Islam&rsquo;s holiest sites. Police deployed stun grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas against the Palestinians. They branded them as <em>&ldquo;vandals&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;law-breaking and masked youths,&rdquo;</em> and accused them of throwing fireworks and other projectiles at officers. Some 400 Palestinians were detained, with dozens reported injured.</p>

                            <p><strong>The office of Sweden’s prosecutor also noted various “influence attempts” associated with the high-profile incident</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Swedish prosecutor investigating the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines has said that an attack by a state actor remains the <em>&ldquo;absolute main scenario&rdquo;</em> in its probe of the crime. This contradicts claims by some Western media, which pointed the finger at a <em>&ldquo;pro-Ukrainian group&rdquo;</em> not linked to any government, as a likely culprit.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We believe it will be rather difficult to determine who did this,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;investigator Mats Ljungqvist told Reuters&nbsp;on Thursday. The people behind the sabotage <em>&ldquo;took care so that the evidence would not point in one direction, but in several directions.&rdquo;</em> However, he said, the type of explosives used in the attack ruled out <em>&ldquo;a very large number of actors.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Reports by US, German and British news outlets previously claimed that a small group of <em>&ldquo;pro-Ukrainian&rdquo;</em> divers, possibly funded by wealthy individuals, could have pulled off the elaborate sabotage. This scenario is what Western intelligence services believe happened, the reports claimed.</p>
<p>Ljungqvist said some private companies specializing in <em>&ldquo;certain special missions&rdquo;</em> could <em>&ldquo;in theory, carry this out.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t rule out anything, but that it is a state actor who is directly or at least indirectly behind this is of course our absolute main scenario, given all the circumstances,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>

<p>Powerful explosions ripped through the Nord Stream pipelines last September, rendering the multibillion dollar projects incapable of pumping Russian natural gas to Germany and other European countries. Sweden is one of three EU nations conducting an investigation, as some of the blasts went off in its waters. The two others are Denmark, a stakeholder for the same reason as Sweden, and Germany.</p>
<p>Veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported in February that the sabotage had been ordered by US President Joe Biden and carried out by a joint US-Norwegian team. Both nations denied the allegations, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said he concurred with Hersh&rsquo;s conclusions.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported this week that Nord Stream became a topic carefully avoided during Western meetings. A diplomatic source said the incident was <em>&ldquo;like a corpse at a family gathering&rdquo;</em> that everyone pretends not to notice. The article claimed politicians in Europe suspect that Ukraine or Poland could have been behind the incident, but didn&rsquo;t mention the US as a possible perpetrator.</p>
<p>Ljungqvist&rsquo;s office on Thursday released an official update on the Nord Stream investigation. The statement explained that the incident <em>&ldquo;has obviously become an open arena for different influence attempts&rdquo;</em> and pledged to follow the facts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The US has deployed an aircraft carrier in the vicinity of Taiwan, the self-governing island&rsquo;s Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng has revealed. A Chinese warship of the same class is also in the area.</p>
<p>The arrival of USS Nimitz coincided with a meeting between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China considers the Taiwan to be part of its territory and strongly opposes Taipei&rsquo;s contacts with Washington.</p>
<p>Speaking before its parliament&rsquo;s Foreign and National Defense Committee on Thursday, Chiu said the American vessel was 400 nautical miles (460 miles/740km) east of Taiwan. He also mentioned the deployment of China&rsquo;s Shandong aircraft carrier 370km from the southernmost tip of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Chiu declined to comment on whether the US warship had arrived in the area in response to Shandong&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>Tsai and McCarthy held a two-hour meeting behind closed doors in&nbsp;Simi Valley, California on Wednesday morning, with 18 bipartisan members of Congress also in attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re stronger when we are together,</em>&rdquo; Tsai told McCarthy on Wednesday, expressing gratitude for Washington&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>efforts to protect our way of life.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCarthy responded by describing &ldquo;<em>friendship between the people of Taiwan and America</em> [as] <em>a matter of profound importance to the free world.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last time Tsai met with McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, back in August 2022, there was a major escalation between Washington and Beijing, with China launching its largest-ever military drills in the Taiwan Strait and slapping sanctions on Taipei.</p>
<p>Commenting on Tsai&rsquo;s latest talks with the top US official, China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday, condemning the get-together.</p>
<p>Diplomats warned that China would take &ldquo;<em>strong and resolute measures</em>&rdquo; in response to Washington&rsquo;s and Taipei&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>egregiously wrong action,</em>&rdquo; adding that the Taiwan issue was the &ldquo;<em>first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949, when the losing side in the Chinese civil war fled to the island and established its own administration there. While only a handful of nations have recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state, the US has long maintained close, unofficial ties with Taipei, both militarily and economically. On paper, however, Washington professes to still adhere to the &lsquo;One-China&rsquo; principle.</p>
<p>Beijing considers the island to be an inalienable part of its territory that has been seized by separatists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Sanna Marin will remain Finland’s prime minister until a new cabinet is formed</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finnish President Sauli Niinisto has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Sanna Marin just days after the country became the 31st member of NATO, the president&rsquo;s office has announced.</p>
<p>Marin submitted her request to step down during a meeting with Niinisto at the Mantyniemi presidential residence in Helsinki on Thursday.</p>
<p>The president asked her to continue in a caretaker role until a new government is formed, the statement read.</p>
<p>Marin&rsquo;s resignation follows the defeat for her Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the parliamentary election last weekend. The SPD finished third in the vote, securing 43 seats out of 200 in the Finnish legislature.</p>
<p>The leader of the rightist National Coalition party, Petteri Orpo, is set to become the new prime minister, and will likely begin talks on forming a coalition government after the parliament convenes on April 14. He is expected to put together a new cabinet before a holiday in June.</p>

<p>Marin became prime minister in 2019 at the age of 34, making her the youngest person in Finnish history to head the government.</p>
<p>During her tenure, Finland applied to become a NATO member, citing concern over the conflict in Ukraine. It was officially accepted into the US-led military bloc on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new era as a NATO member begins for Finland,&rdquo; the outgoing prime minister said of the development, insisting that the population had &ldquo;acted in unison throughout this historic process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov warned that Helsinki&rsquo;s new status would affect relations with Moscow, as NATO is <em>&ldquo;unfriendly and, in many ways, hostile to Russia.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will apply countermeasures to ensure our security in a tactical and strategic sense,&rdquo;</em> he vowed.</p>
<p>Finland&rsquo;s national debt has surpassed 70% of GDP since Marin took office as she prioritized funding for pensions and education programs, with polls identifying debt as among the main reasons for her election defeat.</p>

                            <p><strong>The former Italian prime minister was admitted to a Milan hospital on Wednesday after experiencing difficulty breathing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Silvio Berlusconi, a prime minister in four Italian governments and one of the country's most dominant business and political figures, has been diagnosed with leukemia and admitted to intensive care, his doctors confirmed on Thursday. The 86-year-old was hospitalized in Milan on Wednesday after complaining of breathing problems.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Silvio Berlusconi is currently in intensive care to treat a lung infection,&rdquo;</em> a statement released by his medical team at Milan&rsquo;s San Raffaele Hospital said on Thursday, via the ANSA news agency. They also confirmed that he had been diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which has contributed to the lung condition.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The infectious event is framed in the context of a chronic blood condition of which he has been a bearer for some time,&rdquo;</em> it added. The medical team, which is headed by Berlusconi&rsquo;s personal physician Alberto Zangrillo, said a <em>&ldquo;therapeutic strategy&rdquo;</em> would be implemented to limit the <em>&ldquo;negative effects&rdquo;</em> of his condition.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Berlusconi spent a quiet night, his condition is stable,&rdquo;</em> Italian Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani, who also serves as foreign minister, told RAI television earlier on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;We all want to be optimistic and we hope that the lion will return soon to take charge of the party. He&rsquo;s our political leader and of course he never gives up.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Berlusconi heads the Forza Italia party, which forms part of the right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, although he does not have a role in government.</p>
<p>The former prime minister began a course of chemotherapy on Wednesday, the ANSA news agency reported, adding that he remains in a stable condition as of Thursday.</p>
<p>The Forza Italia Party released a statement&nbsp;also on Thursday emphasizing that Berlusconi had called for <em>&ldquo;maximum commitment&rdquo;</em> in parliament following his hospitalization.</p>
<p>The often-controversial Berlusconi has been a semi-permanent fixture in Italian politics for decades. He served as prime minister from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011. He was suspended from politics for six years after a tax fraud conviction, but returned to Italy&rsquo;s senate last year following national elections.</p>
<p>The former media mogul has faced several scandals throughout his tenure at the summit of Italy&rsquo;s legislature. He has been on trial more than 30 times for alleged crimes ranging from abuse of office, defamation, and association with the mafia.</p>
<p>In 2011, he was investigated for allegedly having sex with an underage prostitute at one of his notorious &lsquo;bunga bunga&rsquo; parties, but was later acquitted after a judge found that Berlusconi was unaware that the girl was underage. Berlusconi denied the claims against him.</p>
<p>Outside of politics, Berlusconi is known for his work in building Italy&rsquo;s largest television network, as well as his former ownership of soccer team AC Milan.

                            <p><strong>The US newspaper reported that Beijing’s envoy had downplayed partnership with Moscow and tried to distance his country from it</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The New York Times (NYT) failed to accurately reflect China&rsquo;s position on relations with&nbsp;Russia in this week's&nbsp;account of an interview with Beijing&rsquo;s ambassador to the EU, the diplomat&rsquo;s office has said.</p>
<p>In an article published on Wednesday, the newspaper stated that Fu Cong tried to distance Beijing from Moscow, and downplayed the ties between the two powers.</p>
<p>A reporter asked about a key joint statement signed last year by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which declared the friendship between the nations as having <em>&ldquo;no limits.&rdquo;</em> The ambassador, according to the newspaper, replied that there can be no such thing as a friendship with <em>&ldquo;no limit&rdquo;</em> and that the description was <em>&ldquo;nothing but rhetoric.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Chinese mission to the EU told the Russian news agency TASS that the interview with the NYT was about an hour long and that the highlights printed by the paper failed to properly convey Fu&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The ambassador stated that some people deliberately misinterpret the Chinese position [on the crisis in Ukraine]. The things that China did and didn&rsquo;t do since the start of the conflict are known in Europe and the rest of the world,&rdquo;</em> the news agency quoted the mission as saying on Thursday.</p>

<p>The diplomat&rsquo;s office clarified that there was no sense in discussing the meaning of a <em>&ldquo;no-limits&rdquo;</em> friendship, and that the term did not imply that China was going to provide military assistance to Russia.</p>
<p>Western officials have warned China not to send arms to Russia, threatening <em>&ldquo;consequences&rdquo;</em> should it make such a move. Beijing has stressed that it has no such plans, and accused Washington of <em>&ldquo;spreading false information&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;fanning the flames&rdquo;</em> of the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the NYT piece, stating that the Russian government was <em>&ldquo;guided by the substance of the bilateral contacts&rdquo;</em> that Putin and Xi had during the Chinese leader&rsquo;s visit to Moscow last month.</p>
<p>During the three-day trip, Russian and Chinese officials signed more than a dozen bilateral agreements. The talks and the documents <em>&ldquo;were quite substantive and fully reflect the range of issues on our shared agenda,&rdquo;</em> Peskov stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing has released a report on Washington’s lies and manipulation as the US drums up the ‘democracy vs authoritarianism’ debate</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US played co-host to the second &lsquo;Summit for Democracy&rsquo; last week along with the governments of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia.</p>
<p>The two-day event was a gathering of world leaders in a virtual, plenary format, where representatives from government, civil society, and the private sector took part. The biennial exercise ostensibly seeks to strengthen democracy, defend against authoritarianism, fight corruption, and promote civil society&rsquo;s respect for human rights.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/03/29/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-summit-for-democracy-virtual-plenary-on-democracy-delivering-on-global-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> the objectives of the event in his opening remarks in Washington on Wednesday as <em>&ldquo;not just to speak high-minded words and shine a spotlight on those critical issues, but to galvanize actions that translate to concrete progress for people around the world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3><strong>The American vision of democracy</strong></h3>
<p>President Biden reminded the audience that democracy is <em>&ldquo;working,&rdquo;</em> despite accepting its decline in the past 15 years. Unfazed by the headwinds of democratic recession, he cited three examples to drive his point home.</p>
<p>For instance, the oil-rich southern African nation of Angola has built an independent judiciary that would expedite justice. The Dominican Republic, a Caribbean nation, has given more teeth to its anti-corruption law. Similarly, Croatia, an eastern European country in the Balkan peninsula, is on overdrive to increase transparency in governance, according to the US president.</p>

<p>He singled out <em>&ldquo;the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their democracy&rdquo;</em> against Russia while pledging $690 million &ndash; in addition to the $400 million that was committed in December 2021 in the first edition of the summit &ndash; to promote democracy across the world for the next two years. Overall, the US has given around $80 billion in aid to Ukraine, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64656301)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$46.6 billion</a> to buy weapons, under the guise of defending democracy and upholding human rights.</p>
<p>Washington promised to loosen its purse strings as the Biden administration seeks to commit $9.5 billion to <em>&ldquo;advance democracy&rdquo;</em> around the world.</p>
<p>Altogether, the Biden administration had invited 120 world leaders to the summit. However, a day ahead of the summit, Pakistan, an &lsquo;all-weather ally&rsquo; of China and a primary US <em>&ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo;</em> adversary, struck a discordant note and pulled out.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Pakistan Defense Committee Mushahid Hussain Syed<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202303/1288232.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> lashed out</a> at the US for &ldquo;<em>weaponizing democracy and human rights in the emerging World War against China and Russia,&rdquo;</em> as the world stands divided on whether Washington&rsquo;s model of democracy is worth emulating.</p>
<h3><strong>A &lsquo;slap in the face&rsquo; for the US?</strong></h3>
<p>Ahead of the Biden administration&rsquo;s democracy brouhaha, China couldn&rsquo;t have found a more opportune moment &ndash; the 20th anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq on March 20 &ndash; to release a damning report against Washington. The report, published by China&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202303/t20230320_11044481.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20vicious%20cycle,the%20rich%20and%20poor%20worsened" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entitled</a>, &lsquo;The State of Democracy in the United States: 2022&rsquo; is a trenchant criticism of the <em>&ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo;</em> American democracy and how it has had a cascading chaotic effect on the world at large.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s evaluation was released amid growing signs that countries of the Global South are showing discontent against the growing US hegemony and turning elsewhere &ndash; a trend that some analysts see as a &ldquo;<em><a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202303/1287630.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slap in the face</a></em>&rdquo; for the US.</p>
<p>The report is divided in four parts and peppered with facts, media comments and expert opinions. China has found a pattern and noted the <em>&ldquo;vicious cycle of democratic pretensions, dysfunctional politics and a divided society that continued in the US.</em>&rdquo; It has identified maladies such as &ldquo;<em>money politics, identity politics, social rifts, and the gulf between the rich and poor&rdquo;</em> that<em> &ldquo;further revealed US&ensp;governance failure and institutional defects.&rdquo;</em> Beijing has categorically blamed the failure of the US democratic system in learning its lessons while referring to the Capitol Hill riots on January 6, 2021, as &ldquo;<em>political violence continued to grow and deteriorate.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Beijing has questioned the concerted efforts of the US to monopolize the definition of democracy, which, in turn, has been a cause for concern while instigating &ldquo;<em>division and confrontation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Washington has been singled out as the primary violator of the United Nations (UN) charter and other allied international laws and norms. China cites examples of meddling in its internal affairs on issues <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-04/20/c_139893941.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">related</a> to its Communist ideology, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Xinjiang province and Tibet. Beijing has also taken a dig at the US for its subversive role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict that entered its second year on February 24.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the selective way the US democratic outreach works on a global stage, the Chinese publication cites a report by the Serbian Center for Strategic Prognosis think tank, which pointed out that <em>&ldquo;the US saw Russia&rsquo;s 1999 attack on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, as a crime, but called a similar American operation in Fallujah, an Iraqi city about the size of Grozny, liberation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s so-called democracy has long been hijacked by interest groups and capital, and brought instability and chaos to the world,&rdquo;</em> the report concludes.</p>
<p>Slamming the Biden administration&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;democracy&rdquo;</em> outreach as a bid to ratchet up tension and confrontation among nations with divergent views, China&rsquo;s report advocates for a confluence of solidarity as a &ldquo;<em>collective response to global challenges,&rdquo;</em> where freedom, democracy and human rights are practiced the same way they are preached.</p>
<h3><strong>Define <em>&ldquo;democracy&rdquo;</em></strong></h3>
<p>Some of the global leaders invited to the Summit for Democracy have had questionable credentials. Consider this: India&rsquo;s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has been disqualified as a Parliamentarian as a lower court in Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s home state of Gujarat has handed down a two-year jail sentence. Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu is on a warpath back home for curbing judicial independence. Mexican President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador&rsquo;s reforms threaten democracy amid looming fears over a bid to end free and fair elections. Meanwhile, European Union members Turkey and Hungary were kept out of the frame ostensibly because they lack civil liberties that would classify these nations as illiberal democracies.</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine are two more prime examples of the Biden administration&rsquo;s selective approach to defining democracy. Russia, despite US reservations, remains a liberal democracy. Ukraine, under President Vladimir Zelensky, has slid into an autocratic regime where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.democratic-erosion.com/2022/02/05/autocratic-behavioral-warning-signs-during-zelenskis-presidential-rule-in-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corruption and personal loyalties</a> have been preferred over meritocracy and competence &ndash; fighting corruption was among the campaign promises that helped him win the election, but were quickly abandoned after he assumed office.</p>
<p>As a self-proclaimed &lsquo;champion of democracy&rsquo;, the US is spreading good cheer and basking in its own glory, acting primarily in its own interests while professing to be doing common good for other nations.</p>

<p>When necessary, it will attempt to manufacture democracy at gunpoint, like it tried to do in Iraq and Afghanistan. While it invariably fails to bring about actual democratic change, it&rsquo;s always successful in creating lucrative markets for the American military industrial complex and other companies.</p>
<p>One must look no further than the Middle East and the Arab world, where the US has been the biggest catalyst of conflict, bloodshed and human misery. The US sees the volatile region as a ready market buoyed by oil revenues to sell arms and military hardware with impunity, as several Arab nations are locked in protracted conflicts with their neighbors such as Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s fight against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, is pouring money into nations of the Global South, whose suffering has been aggravated because of Western sanctions, making them dependent on Beijing&rsquo;s largesse &ndash; and doing so without trying to educate them on values and the drummed-up global conflict between authoritarianism and democracy.</p>
<p>The US is unlikely to win over these fledgling democracies, who are tired of Washington&rsquo;s penchant for giving sermons and setting political conditions. Ultimately, the Global South will be loyal to those who are willing to offer a line of credit and generous financial assistance. All the White House has to offer them are platitudes &ndash; democracy be damned!</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The long-time regional rivals have agreed to reopen embassies after a ministerial meeting in Beijing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia, two long-time regional rivals, have agreed to reopen their nations&rsquo; respective embassies and consulates during talks in China. Tehran and Riyadh made a surprise announcement on the normalization of diplomatic ties last month, with Beijing mediating the effort.</p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud met in the Chinese capital on Thursday, seeking to build on the momentum from the March 10 agreement.</p>
<p>A joint statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry detailed a number of measures, including the upcoming reopening of diplomatic missions. The Iranian ambassador to China told journalists that the embassies and consulates would open their doors <em>&ldquo;soon,&rdquo;</em> according to the Iranian news agency ISNA.</p>
<p>The two ministers also pledged to continue reengagement in other areas, including direct flights, issuing travel visas, commerce, and security cooperation. Iran and Saudi Arabia were described as <em>&ldquo;brotherly nations&rdquo;</em> in the statement. The ministers thanked China for hosting them and Switzerland for its role in representing the interests of the two nations.</p>

<p>The senior diplomats are also expected to make direct visits to each other&rsquo;s countries as part of the restoration of bilateral ties.

            <p>The US deployed B-52 strategic bombers as part of military exercises with South Korea on Wednesday, prompting a warning from North Korea that Washington&rsquo;s increased military activity in the region could cause tensions to reach boiling point.</p>
<p>The South Korean Defense Ministry said the maneuvers marked the first time in a month that the nuclear-capable aircraft had flown over the peninsula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[The exercises] <em>show the strong resolve of the</em> [South] <em>Korea-US alliance and its perfect readiness to respond to any provocation by North Korea swiftly and overwhelmingly,</em>&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Park Ha Sik, commander of the South Korean air force operation command, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Along with the bombers, F-35 and F-16 fighters also took part in the joint exercise.</p>

<p>US Seventh Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Scott L. Pleus claimed that ties with South Korea are &ldquo;<em>stronger than ever,</em>&rdquo; and that their respective air forces are capable of completing &ldquo;<em>any mission we will be tasked with</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>North Korean state news agency KCNA responded to the drills in an article on Thursday, warning that the actions by Washington and Seoul could lead the situation on the peninsula &ldquo;<em>to an irreversible catastrophe.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article, written by North Korean international security analyst Choe Ju Hyon, accused the US and &ldquo;<em>its followers</em>&rdquo; of making &ldquo;<em>threatening remarks against the DPRK,</em>&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;<em>steadily escalating the intensity and scale</em>&rdquo; of their &ldquo;<em>aggressive</em>&rdquo; drills since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Choe warned that the &ldquo;<em>military provocations by the US-led warmongers have gone beyond the tolerance limit,</em>&rdquo; and described Washington as a &ldquo;<em>cancer-like entity threatening regional security and global peace.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US previously deployed B-52 bombers to the region in early March, as well as in December of last year.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul have insisted their joint drills are defensive in nature and are intended as a response to the recent uptick in Pyongyang&rsquo;s missile tests. The North has claimed that the two nations are rehearsing for a war of aggression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made his candidacy official, challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic Party’s 2024 nomination</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a longshot bid for the US presidency, entering the 2024 race as a Democratic candidate who will challenge his party&rsquo;s stance on issues ranging from vaccines to foreign policy and censorship.</p>
<p>Kennedy, the son of 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy &ndash; both of whom were assassinated &ndash; filed his statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday. He and self-help author Marianne Williamson have become the first two Democratic candidates to enter the race, presumably taking on 80-year-old Joe Biden, who has indicated that he plans to seek re-election despite already being the country&rsquo;s oldest ever president.</p>
<p>As a scion of one of America&rsquo;s most famous political dynasties, Kennedy, 69, will at least have name recognition on his side as he campaigns for the presidential nomination. However, he has been&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;over his opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates.</p>

<p>Kennedy had hinted about a White House run in recent weeks, saying in a Twitter post last month that he wanted supporters to help him to decide whether to challenge Biden. <em>&ldquo;If it looks like I can raise the money and mobilize enough people to win, I&rsquo;ll jump in the race. If I run, my top priority will be to end the corrupt merger between state and corporate power that has ruined our economy, shattered the middle class, polluted our landscapes and waters, poisoned our children, and robbed us of our values and freedoms. Together, we can restore America&rsquo;s democracy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>A long-time environmental lawyer, author and anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy filed a class-action lawsuit last month against Biden, former Covid-19 czar Dr. Anthony Fauci, and other administration officials for compelling social media platforms to censor jab critics. He has called for the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, saying, <em>&ldquo;There is no America without a Free Press. There is no Free Press without a free Julian Assange.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kennedy has also spoken out against the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s planned digital currency, and accused the CIA of suppressing records related to the 1963 assassination of his uncle. Earlier this week, he blamed a policy of using military power to enforce global hegemony for the loss of US influence over Saudi Arabia and the Gulf monarchy&rsquo;s new alliances with China and Iran.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Ukraine war is the final collapse of the neocon's short-lived &lsquo;American Century,&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> Kennedy said. <em>&ldquo;The neocon projects in Iraq and Ukraine have cost $8.1 trillion, hollowed out our middle class, made a laughingstock of US military power and moral authority, pushed China and Russia into an invincible alliance, destroyed the dollar as the global currency, cost millions of lives and done nothing to advance democracy or win friendships or influence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The military industrial complex has <em>&ldquo;sewed [sic] chaos&rdquo;</em> globally while obliterating America&rsquo;s moral authority and impoverishing the middle class, Kennedy said last month. He pledged: <em>&ldquo;I want to bridge the toxic polarization that divides Republicans and Democrats allowing elites to capture our government.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing has demanded that Washington stops all contacts with Taipei “at once”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Taiwan issue is the <em>&ldquo;first red line&rdquo;</em> that should not be crossed in relations between China and the US, Beijing has told Washington.</p>
<p>The warning from the Chinese Foreign Ministry came early on Thursday, hours after Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen met with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other lawmakers in California.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;China firmly opposes and strongly condemns&rdquo;</em> the high-profile meeting that took place on American soil, the ministry said in a statement. <em>&ldquo;It seriously infringes upon China&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and sends an egregiously wrong signal to the &lsquo;Taiwan independence&rsquo; separatist forces,&rdquo;</em> it added.</p>
<p>Beijing will take<em> &ldquo;strong and resolute measures&rdquo;</em> in response to <em>&ldquo;egregiously wrong action&rdquo;</em> taken by Washington and Taipei, the ministry warned.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Taiwan question is at the core of China&rsquo;s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations,&rdquo;</em> the statement read.</p>
<p>According to Beijing, an independent Taipei and stability in the Taiwan Strait were as <em>&ldquo;irreconcilable as fire and water.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the US <em>&ldquo;not go further down the wrong and dangerous path&rdquo;</em> of trying to use the Taiwan issue to<em> &ldquo;contain&rdquo;</em> China. Washington should adhere to the One-China principle and <em>&ldquo;stop at once any form of official exchanges with Taiwan,&rdquo;</em> it said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, but never officially declared independence from China. Beijing, which considers the island to be a part of its territory, strongly opposes its contacts with the US.</p>
<p>Despite officially recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate authority in China since 1979, Washington maintains strong unofficial ties with Taipei, supporting its push for sovereignty and promising to defend the island militarily in the event of an attack from the mainland.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stronger when we are together,&rdquo;</em> Tsai told McCarthy during their meeting on Wednesday. The Taiwanese leader said she was grateful to the US for helping with <em>&ldquo;efforts to protect our way of life.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>McCarthy said <em>&ldquo;friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance to the free world. It is critical to maintain economic freedom, peace and regional stability.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the second time that Tsai has met a US House speaker in less than a year. A visit by McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, to Taiwan last August caused a major spike in tensions between Beijing and Washington as China launched its largest-ever military drills in the Taiwan Strait and slapped sanctions on Taipei.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Senior Israeli officials have questioned whether Washington would tolerate Iranian nuclear weapons</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Israel has reportedly lodged protests and sought <em>&ldquo;clarifications&rdquo;</em> from the White House, after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told lawmakers that the United States would never allow Iran to have a <em>&ldquo;fielded&rdquo;</em> nuclear weapon, fearing his language indicated a shift in US policy.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Israeli officials sounded the alarm after General Milley&nbsp;gave a congressional testimony last week and stated that Washington <em>&ldquo;remains committed as a matter of policy that Iran will not have a fielded nuclear weapon,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/05/milley-iran-israel-nuclear-weapon-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to Axios. The outlet said the officials believed his comments could mean the US <em>&ldquo;would tolerate Tehran having a nuclear weapons program&rdquo;</em> so long as no bombs were <em>&ldquo;fielded&rdquo;</em> on a missile or other delivery system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Several unnamed sources told Axios that the concerns came from the Israeli Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office, the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Ministry and the Mossad intelligence service, noting that Milley&rsquo;s testimony <em>&ldquo;alarmed Israeli defense and intelligence officials to the point they protested.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong></strong>Tehran has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, with Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei even issuing religious edicts against the atom bomb and other weapons of mass destruction. Nonetheless, US officials and their Israeli counterparts have continued to accuse the Islamic Republic of pursuing a nuclear arsenal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Israeli officials pushed the top general to <em>&ldquo;clarify his remarks or retract them,&rdquo;</em> and at another House hearing just days later, Milley offered a similar statement about Iran, but without the word <em>&ldquo;fielded.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We asked the Biden administration to fix it and they did,&rdquo;</em> a senior Israeli official told Axios.</p>
<p><strong></strong>However, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs, Joseph Holstead, later said US policy toward Iran <em>&ldquo;remains the same,&rdquo;</em> adding that Milley&rsquo;s prior language did not indicate any change and was simply&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;military vernacular.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Preventive action could have stopped a 2017 mass shooting by an ex-government employee, plaintiffs allege</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has agreed to shell out $144.5 million to settle a lawsuit claiming the government failed to share background information about a former Air Force serviceman who later killed 26 people in a shooting spree.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-multimillion-dollar-civil-settlement-principle-sutherland-springs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the multi-million dollar settlement on Wednesday, saying it had reached an <em>&ldquo;agreement in principle&rdquo;</em> to end a civil case which arose from the November 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas by Air Force vet Devin Patrick Kelley.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No words or amount of money can diminish the immense tragedy of the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs,&rdquo;</em> Associate US Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement. <em>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement brings the litigation to a close, ending a painful chapter for the victims of this unthinkable crime.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>More than 75 plaintiffs joined the lawsuit, which alleged that the US Air Force could have prevented the rampage, had it transmitted the gunman&rsquo;s criminal history into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The DOJ acknowledged that Kelley would have been unable to purchase guns from a federally licensed dealer if his name had been in the system, after a federal judge ruled that the government was <em>&ldquo;liable for damages caused by the shooting.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Although some aspects of the pay-out must be approved in court, officials said the $144.5 million would <em>&ldquo;settle all claims&rdquo;</em> related to the case. The DOJ previously attempted to appeal the liability ruling, but at the time noted that the parties in the case were working toward a resolution out of court.</p>
<p>While still in the Air Force, Kelley faced a court martial in 2012 for domestic violence charges and was prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The military did not record the conviction with the FBI-run NICS database, allowing Kelley to buy weapons freely.</p>
<p><strong></strong>After murdering 26 worshippers and wounding 22 others at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Kelley was confronted by a local resident armed with a rifle and ultimately fled the scene. Police later found the gunman dead in his car from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Among his victims were an unborn child, the pastor&rsquo;s 14-year-old daughter and the shooter&rsquo;s own grandmother-in-law.</p>

                            <p><strong>The head of the US-led military bloc also unveiled a new “strategic multi-year assistance program” for Kiev</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has urged China to halt its <em>&ldquo;growing alignment&rdquo;</em> with Russia, warning that any military assistance from Beijing to Moscow during the conflict in Ukraine would be a <em>&ldquo;historic mistake&rdquo;</em> with&nbsp;major consequences.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking after the conclusion of a NATO <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_213478.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign ministers meeting</a> in Brussels on Wednesday, Stoltenberg sounded the alarm over Moscow&rsquo;s friendly ties with the People&rsquo;s Republic,&nbsp;insisting Beijing could soon offer weapons to Russia despite its&nbsp;repeated confirmation that it has no plans to do so.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;China refuses to condemn Russia&rsquo;s aggression&hellip; And it props up Russia&rsquo;s economy,&rdquo;</em> he claimed, adding <em>&ldquo;Allies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While the NATO head did not elaborate on the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;implications,&rdquo;</em> Washington has previously threatened to respond to military support for Russia, while the US Treasury has already moved ahead with <a href="https://archive.ph/FQuIp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctions</a> for several China-based companies accused of supplying parts for drones allegedly used by&nbsp;Moscow's forces.</p>

<p>Beijing has repeatedly&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-jake-sullivan-yang-jiechi-europe-china-b995f55b54278ed9cde0067fe74cd68c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a>&nbsp;it intends to supply&nbsp;weapons to Moscow, insisting it is <em>&ldquo;completely objective&rdquo;</em> toward the conflict while accusing US officials of spreading <em>&ldquo;disinformation&rdquo;</em> on the matter. Russia, too, has denied previous reports that it requested Chinese military equipment.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The two countries have nonetheless stepped up relations over the last year, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping vowing to <em>&ldquo;further deepen military mutual trust&rdquo;</em> after talks at the Kremlin last month. However, Putin has since <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-26/putin-says-russia-and-china-are-not-creating-a-military-alliance/102147740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that Russia is <em>&ldquo;not creating any military alliance with China,&rdquo;</em> despite their <em>&ldquo;cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Stoltenberg went on to say that the alliance had agreed to create a <em>&ldquo;strategic multi-year assistance program&rdquo;</em> for Kiev. He voiced hopes that the project would <em>&ldquo;increase Ukraine&rsquo;s interoperability with NATO, and to bring it up to NATO standards,&rdquo;</em> as well as assist the country <em>&ldquo;on its path to Euro-Atlantic integration.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>During a press briefing after the first day of discussions in Brussels on Tuesday, Stoltenberg was asked when Kiev would be admitted into the bloc, but could not provide an answer, merely saying that NATO&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;position on membership is unchanged.&rdquo;</em> While the alliance first offered a seat to Ukraine back in 2008, it appears little progress has been made in the 15 years since, with one unnamed Western diplomat recently telling the Financial Times that NATO is simply <em>&ldquo;ignoring&rdquo;</em> Kiev&rsquo;s membership application.</p>

                            <p><strong>Peter Murrell, spouse of Nicola Sturgeon, was questioned as part of a probe into her party’s finances</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Peter Murrell, the husband of former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, was <em>&ldquo;arrested as a suspect&rdquo;</em> and questioned on Wednesday <em>&ldquo;in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;according to police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murrell was released without charges <em>&ldquo;pending further investigation&rdquo;</em> after being held for nearly 12 hours, according to police, who said a prosecution report was being compiled for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>
<p>Police reportedly searched the SNP&rsquo;s Edinburgh headquarters and several other addresses as well as Murrell and Sturgeon&rsquo;s Glasgow residence, setting up a large evidence tent over the the front of the house and garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sturgeon had <em>&ldquo;no prior knowledge&rdquo;</em> of the arrest or search, a spokesperson told The Guardian on Wednesday, but <em>&ldquo;will fully cooperate with Police Scotland if required.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The probe arose from complaints about the SNP&rsquo;s handling of over &pound;600,000 ($750,000) in donations solicited to campaign for a second independence referendum. While the promised referendum has been repeatedly postponed with no current date set, despite repeated promises from Sturgeon, the money has allegedly been spent already on daily expenses, leaving the party with a deficit of &pound;752,000 and &pound;145,000 in cash for 2021. Sturgeon insisted at the time that <em>&ldquo;every penny&rdquo;</em> raised for independence campaigning would be spent as donors had intended.</p>

<p>Last year, Murrell was discovered to have loaned the party more than &pound;100,000 to assist with <em>&ldquo;cash flow&rdquo;</em> problems following the last election. Sturgeon also loaned the SNP &pound;107,620 in June 2021, half of which was repaid by October of that year, according to the BBC&nbsp;&ndash; even though a party spokesman claimed the loan was not credit at all but a <em>&ldquo;personal contribution&rdquo;</em> by the chief executive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sturgeon stepped down as head of the SNP in February after eight years in the position, citing mental and physical exhaustion. While she declined to say whether the police inquiry into her party&rsquo;s finances had influenced her decision to quit, her successor, SNP first minister Humza Youssef, said he did not believe it was a factor. Murrell resigned from the party last month after admitting to misleading the public about a decline in its membership numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Youssef, who took office less than two weeks ago, described the news of Murrell&rsquo;s arrest as <em>&ldquo;challenging&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;difficult,&rdquo;</em> pledging the party&rsquo;s ongoing cooperation and pointing out that it had committed to a review on governance and transparency. The SNP has denied all wrongdoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A damning report has claimed that more than 150 church leaders in the Archdiocese of Baltimore committed offenses against minors</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore covered up decades of child sexual abuse by priests and other church leaders dating as far back as the 1940s, the Maryland Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has claimed in a damning report following a four-year investigation.</p>
<p>More than 600 children were sexually abused at the hands of over 150 clergy, nuns, seminarians and deacons, according to the <a href="https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/news%20documents/OAG_redacted_Report_on_Child_Sexual_Abuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>, which was released on Wednesday. The investigation alleged an <em>&ldquo;incontrovertible history&rdquo;</em> of <em>&ldquo;pervasive, pernicious and persistent abuse,&rdquo;</em> which was allowed to continue as diocese officials chose to safeguard the institution rather than protect the children in their congregations and schools.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This report illustrates the depraved, systemic failure of the archdiocese to protect the most vulnerable &ndash; the children it was charged to keep safe,&rdquo;</em> Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement. The report noted that the <em>&ldquo;sheer number of abusers and victims, the depravity of the abusers&rsquo; conduct and the frequency with which known abusers were given the opportunity to continue preying upon children are astonishing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In fact, the abuse was allegedly so pervasive that some churches and schools had more than one offender on staff at the same time. A&nbsp;parish&nbsp;in Catonsville, Maryland, had 11 separate abusers between 1964 and 2004.</p>
<p>The archdiocese, the oldest Roman Catholic diocese in the US, didn&rsquo;t protect victims when allegations of abuse surfaced, according to the state report. For example, when learning in 1987 that a clergyman had sexually abused a 14-year-old girl and admitted to being &ldquo;aroused by some young girls,&rdquo; the diocese told the victim that he would be given therapy and reassigned away from children. The diocese took no other action until additional victims came forward in 1994. By then, the report said, nine other girls had been abused, and there were indications of other victims who chose not to report their cases.</p>
<p>The probe focused on abuse prior to 2002, when a bombshell media report on the coverup of sexual abuse allegations by the Archdiocese of Boston led to reforms by the church, including lifetime bans of offenders. However, the attorney general&rsquo;s office claimed that the Archdiocese of Maryland failed to fully implement needed reforms. For instance, it failed to publicly list all of the abusers it knew about and allowed some to retire with pensions, rather than be ousted.</p>

<p>The report recommended eliminating Maryland&rsquo;s statute of limitations for claims of childhood sexual abuse, allowing victims to file civil lawsuits for their damages. State lawmakers passed such legislation on Wednesday, approving a bill that would end the current restriction barring alleged victims from suing after they reach age 38.</p>

                            <p><strong>Diplomats are still working out how to supply Kiev with artillery, and who will pocket the profits</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The <em>&ldquo;historic&rdquo;</em> agreement to deliver two billion euros ($2.14 billion) worth of artillery ammunition to the Ukrainian military is still being worked out, Politico reported on Wednesday, citing diplomats involved in the negotiations. Concerns over who will get the money are reportedly the main bone of contention.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The plan, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573311-eu-nations-to-jointly-supply-ammo-to-ukraine/">unveiled</a> on March 20, envisioned the delivery of one million 155mm shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months. A package of one billion euros was earmarked for compensating EU members who would dip into their own stockpiles, and another billion for getting new shells made by military contractors, with orders organized and fast-tracked by the EU Defence Agency.</p>
<p>The problem now is figuring out which contractors, according to the pro-NATO <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plan-ukraine-artillery-shell-155mm-war-russia-zelenskyy-putin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlet</a>.</p>
<p>France is reportedly insisting that only EU companies should be considered, but there is legal uncertainty as to who actually qualifies as an EU company. Greece and Cyprus are in alignment with the French position, which diplomats have attributed to a desire to avoid giving orders to T&uuml;rkiye.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the European Commission also needs to &ldquo;map out the capacity&rdquo; of the bloc&rsquo;s defense industry before finalizing the deal, as expanding production may be easier said than done.</p>
<p><strong></strong>EU ambassadors who met on Wednesday weren&rsquo;t able to make significant progress, several diplomats with knowledge of the negotiations told Politico. They did manage to finalize the text of the agreement to collect ammunition donations, however, which should be published next week.</p>
<p><strong></strong>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had proposed the ammunition plan, arguing in February that it was the most important issue. <em>&ldquo;If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger,&rdquo;</em> he said at the time.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The US, EU and NATO have all insisted they were not participants in the conflict, while also arguing that Ukraine must win and Russia <em>&ldquo;must lose.&rdquo;</em> Moscow has repeatedly warned the West to stop <em>&ldquo;stuffing&rdquo;</em> Kiev with arms and ammunition, arguing that they are only delaying the inevitable while risking open confrontation.</p>
<p>Russia has already increased its own ammunition production, tripling the number of shells the US and EU plan to supply Kiev over a year-long period, President Vladimir Putin said last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Tehran must be ready to “take advantage” of the shift in global power, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech to officials</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US is no longer the power it once was, and has failed to rally the Arab world against Iran and curtail its nuclear program, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech to senior officials on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Facts show that America was weaker under Obama&rsquo;s administration than Bush&rsquo;s administration. The US was weaker under Trump&rsquo;s administration than the way it was under Obama&rsquo;s administration. The US is weaker under [Joe Biden&rsquo;s] administration than it was under Trump&rsquo;s administration,&rdquo;</em> Khamenei proclaimed, according to Iran&rsquo;s Tasnim news agency.</p>
<p>Khamenei noted that the US has failed to rally its Middle Eastern allies against Iran, declaring that<em> &ldquo;what has happened is the opposite.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Aside from wielding considerable influence in Iraq and Syria, Iran recently restored relations with Saudi Arabia following talks brokered by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Although not a formal ally of the US, Saudi Arabia has been one of the US&rsquo; closest partners in the region for decades, and is the world&rsquo;s largest purchaser of American weapons. Now, however, Riyadh has <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/574052-opec-oil-production-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuffed</a> Biden&rsquo;s calls to boost oil production and is <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/570056-saudi-arabia-dump-dollar-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing</a> trading energy in currencies other than the US dollar.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo;</em> the Ayatollah continued, <em>&ldquo;the US wanted to put an end to the nuclear program&hellip;through political pressure and sanctions, but it failed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>At present, the US is reportedly discussing a deal whereby Iran would freeze its enrichment of uranium above 60%, in exchange for sanctions relief. Tehran has rejected the proposal, US news outlet Axios reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The Ayatollah went on to note the rise of several <em>&ldquo;anti-American&rdquo;</em> governments in Latin America, the declining importance of the dollar in global trade, the political chaos in Israel, and the diplomatic consequences of the EU <em>&ldquo;taking the brunt of the war&rdquo;</em> in Ukraine on Washington&rsquo;s behalf as examples of the US&rsquo; waning influence.</p>
<p><em>"In order to take advantage of this opportunity, we must increase our dynamism, initiative and activities in foreign policy,"</em> Khamenei said.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Jamie Dimon suggested governments seize private lands to build wind and solar farms so as to meet climate goals</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has urged governments to seize private property in order to build renewable energy infrastructure, arguing that allowing the market to evolve organically will leave humanity with few options in the face of accelerating climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning that <em>&ldquo;the window for action to avert the costliest impacts of global climate change is closing,&rdquo;</em> the bank executive called for <em>&ldquo;permitting reforms&rdquo;</em> in his annual letter to shareholders on Tuesday, arguing <em>&ldquo;we simply are not getting the adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, wind, and pipeline initiatives.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Massive global investment in clean energy technologies must be done and must continue to grow year-over-year,&rdquo;</em> he wrote, insisting <em>&ldquo;governments, businesses, and non-governmental organizations need to align across a series of practical policy changes&rdquo;</em> &ndash; specifically invoking the use of eminent domain in order to expedite the <em>&ldquo;adequate investments&rdquo;</em> in renewable energy.</p>

<p>Eminent domain is the legal process by which the government confiscates private property for public use. More recently (and controversially), however, governments have seized private land under eminent domain for use that primarily (or solely) benefits private corporations, leading some states and municipalities to introduce legislation to protect property owners against what they view as eminent domain abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Iowa House of Representatives passed a bill last month restricting the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies. Pipeline projects will be required to obtain consent from the owners of 90% of their route before they can wield state power against the holdouts if it becomes law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While President Joe Biden committed the US to a 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in greenhouse gases by 2030, Congress remains far from united on the issue of anthropogenic climate change or the importance of reaching net zero emissions.</p>
<p>Later in the 43-page letter, Dimon took aim at the entire American political system: <em>&ldquo;We need to find a way to more rapidly reorganize our government for the new world&rdquo;</em> to <em>&ldquo;adopt new technologies and retrain human capital more quickly.&rdquo;</em> This, he suggested, could be accomplished by adopting a nationwide <em>&ldquo;industrial policy&rdquo;</em> along the lines of China&rsquo;s, subsidizing investments in strategic industries like semiconductors, rare earths, and alternative energy sources. At the same time, Dimon called for reining in regulators, repeatedly complaining that too much red tape would <em>&ldquo;inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The BFMTV <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/elysee/le-pen-battrait-macron-avec-55-des-voix-si-le-second-tour-de-la-presidentielle-avait-lieu-aujourd-hui_AN-202304050540.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> found that Le Pen would emerge from a first electoral round with 31% of the vote, ahead of Macron with 23% and leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon with 18.5%. Such a result would be an eight-point improvement for the National Rally leader, who finished the first round last year with 23% to Macron&rsquo;s 28%.</p>
<p>French presidential elections take place over two rounds if no one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, with the top two candidates from the first round advancing. This has always been the case under the Fifth Republic, and 2022 saw Macron defeat Le Pen by 59% to 41% in the head-to-head runoff.</p>

<p>Today, however, Le Pen would dispatch Macron by 55% to 45%, the poll found. While Macron counted on Republican, Green, and some leftist votes to win the second round last year, far fewer of these voters would switch to backing the president today. For example, while 68% of Green candidate Yannick Jadot&rsquo;s supporters voted for Macron in the second round last year, 52% would do so today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 27% of Macron&rsquo;s voters in 2022 would either abstain or vote for Le Pen if given a rerun, the poll found.</p>
<p>Macron&rsquo;s government invoked special constitutional powers to pass a controversial pension reform bill without a parliamentary vote last month. The bill raised the retirement age for most French workers from 62 to 64, and its passage triggered a nationwide wave of protests and riots. The largest demonstration saw more than a million people take to the streets across the country, and hundreds were arrested in a single day in Paris for lighting fires and clashing with police officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age has long been one of Macron&rsquo;s key goals, with the president describing the move as a <em>&ldquo;just and responsible&rdquo;</em> way to keep France&rsquo;s social security system afloat. Le Pen, who is best known for her opposition to Islamic immigration, focused her 2022 campaign on opposing the pension reforms and hammering Macron for France&rsquo;s rising cost of living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le Pen has continued to oppose the reforms, while condemning some acts of vandalism by protesters. France, she told the AFP news agency last week, <em>&ldquo;has been governed against its wishes. The way [Macron] is ruling will enable political forces with the exact opposite approach to his to gain power.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Pressuring Kiev to give up its nuclear weapons was a mistake, the former US president has said in an interview</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former US President Bill Clinton has opened up about his <em>&ldquo;personal stake&rdquo;</em> in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, telling an Irish media outlet that he regrets pressuring Kiev to give up its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum in 1994.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I feel a personal stake because I got them to agree to give up their nuclear weapons,&rdquo;</em> Clinton told the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2023/0404/1374162-clinton-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTE news service</a> in an interview published on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;And none of them believe that Russia would have pulled this stunt if Ukraine still had their weapons.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The deal <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1994-book1/html/PPP-1994-book1-doc-pg69.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came together</a> in January 1994, when Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and Ukraine&rsquo;s Leonid Kravchuk signed a tripartite agreement to eliminate the nuclear warheads left in Ukrainian territory following the Soviet Union&rsquo;s collapse. Clinton noted that Yeltsin also agreed to never interfere with Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial boundaries because he wanted the former Soviet Republic to give up its nuclear weapons.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I knew that President Putin did not support the agreement . . .,&rdquo;</em> Clinton said of the territorial pledge. <em>&ldquo;They [Ukrainian leaders] were afraid to give them up because they thought that's the only thing that protected them from an expansionist Russia. When it became convenient to him, President Putin broke it and first took Crimea, and I feel terrible about it because Ukraine is a very important country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The former US president also called for Western governments to remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine. <em>&ldquo;I think what Mr. Putin did was very wrong, and I believe Europe and the United States should continue to support Ukraine. There may come a time when the Ukrainian government believes that they can think of a peace agreement they could live with, but I don't think the rest of us should cut and run on them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russian officials have claimed that the US and its NATO allies promised after the Soviet collapse not to expand the Western military bloc into Eastern Europe. Washington&rsquo;s then-secretary of state, James Baker, offered in February 1990 to provide <em>&ldquo;iron-clad guarantees&rdquo;</em> that NATO wouldn&rsquo;t expand <em>&ldquo;one inch eastward&rdquo;</em> if the Soviet Union cooperated on the reunification of Germany as a member of the Western alliance.</p>

<p>However, NATO began to expand during Clinton&rsquo;s second term as president, adding Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as members in 1999. Since then, NATO has added a dozen more members that were formerly Soviet republics or part of Warsaw Pact nations. Clinton told CNN last September that he had no regrets about NATO&rsquo;s expansion. <em>&ldquo;I think we did the right thing at the right time, and if we hadn&rsquo;t done it, this crisis might have occurred even sooner.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The Ukrainian leader also hailed Warsaw's support in the ongoing conflict with Moscow</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky met his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Wednesday, during his first official visit to Poland since the beginning of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You have stood shoulder to shoulder with us, and we are grateful for it,&rdquo;</em> Zelensky stated during the meeting, pledging<em> &ldquo;no borders in political, economic and &ndash; especially important &ndash; in historical terms&rdquo;</em> between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Polish president, for his part, promised to continue supporting Kiev in the conflict, revealing that Warsaw was ready to send all its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine <em>&ldquo;in the future.&rdquo;</em> Poland has previously pledged 14 of its Soviet-made jets.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Today we are trying to get for Ukraine... additional guarantees, security guarantees, which will strengthen Ukraine&rsquo;s military potential,&rdquo;</em> Duda said, adding that Kiev had been protecting the whole of Europe from what he called the threat of <em>&ldquo;Russian imperialism.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Poland has been one of Zelensky&rsquo;s top allies, transferring assorted hardware to bolster the Ukrainian military, including tanks and self-propelled howitzers, as well as rallying international support for such deliveries. Moscow, however, has claimed Warsaw has an alternate agenda, accusing it of pushing Kiev into a military catastrophe in order to seize western Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the head of Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin, claimed that Poland&rsquo;s military assistance to Ukraine was actually part of a secret land grab plan aimed at certain territories that historically belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which today are part of Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Seizing control of the western territories of modern Ukraine, the so-called Kresy [&lsquo;borderlands&rsquo; in Polish], is the coveted dream of the Polish nationalists,&rdquo;</em> Naryshkin said, adding that Warsaw sees <em>&ldquo;the collapse of Ukrainian statehood after a military defeat as a condition for implementing this idea.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Over the course of the ongoing conflict, Naryshkin has repeatedly warned of the alleged Polish designs on Ukraine&rsquo;s territory. Warsaw, however, has denied such claims, dismissing them as an information warfare operation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>NPR has asked for the label to be removed from its account</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Twitter account of US government-funded broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) has&nbsp;contacted&nbsp;Twitter after its account sprouted a <em>&ldquo;US state-affiliated media&rdquo;</em> tag on Tuesday, claiming the label must have been applied in error.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This must be a mistake as it contradicts Twitter&rsquo;s own guidelines,&rdquo;</em> a spokesperson for the public broadcaster told Mediiate. <em>&ldquo;We have reached out to Twitter to have the label removed.&rdquo;</em> As of Wednesday afternoon, the label remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to a congratulatory tweet from one of his followers highlighting the change to NPR&rsquo;s profile, Twitter CEO Elon Musk retweeted a section of the platform&rsquo;s rules reading: <em>&ldquo;State-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

]]><![CDATA[
    

<p><em>&ldquo;Seems accurate,&rdquo;</em> Musk observed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s content guidelines, which previously read <em>&ldquo;state-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the US for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media,&rdquo;</em> were reportedly edited briefly to remove the NPR reference, though the mention had been restored by Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Musk responded with <em>&ldquo;!&rdquo;</em> to being tagged by Twitter Files journalist Michael Shellenberger about an NPR article scoffing at a <em>"right-wing"</em> European <em>&ldquo;conspiracy theory that elites want people to eat bugs,&rdquo;</em> placed side-by-side with another NPR piece approvingly describing <em>&ldquo;Indigenous people&rdquo;</em> in the Americas eating insects before European explorers arrived.</p>
<p>NPR retains its gold verification badge, which marks it as <em>&ldquo;an official organization on Twitter.&rdquo;</em> Tweets from accounts bearing the <em>&ldquo;state-affiliated media&rdquo;</em> label are not recommended or amplified by Twitter in user searches. The tags were initially adopted in 2020 to further marginalize Russian and Chinese state media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter removed the &lsquo;verified&rsquo; checkmark from the New York Times&rsquo; profile on Saturday in line with a recently announced policy of stripping badges from &lsquo;legacy accounts&rsquo; that were verified before Musk rolled out the paid subscription system last year. The Times has refused to pay the $1,000 monthly business verification fee or reimburse its employees for the $8 monthly personal verification fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on the Times&rsquo; fall from verification, Musk remarked that <em>&ldquo;the real tragedy of @NYTimes is that their propaganda isn&rsquo;t even interesting,&rdquo;</em> calling the paper&rsquo;s account on his platform <em>&ldquo;the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The billionaire has repeatedly clashed with the US media establishment, whose leading voices have accused him of promoting right-wing talking points since his purchase of Twitter and subsequent dismissal of the platform&rsquo;s pro-censorship executives and staff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The country has asked Beijing for help in curbing fentanyl traffic</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called on Chinese leader Xi Jinping to help crack down on fentanyl trafficking amid <em>&ldquo;deceitful and irresponsible&rdquo;</em> claims by US officials that Mexico is to blame for Washington&rsquo;s drug crisis.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Unjustly, they are blaming us for problems that in large measure have to do with their loss of values, their welfare crisis,&rdquo;</em> Lopez Obrador wrote to Xi in a March 22 letter that he <a href="https://twitter.com/JesusRCuevas/status/1643271685859057664/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed to reporters</a> on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;These positions are in themselves a lack of respect and a threat to our sovereignty, and moreover they are based on an absurd, manipulative, propagandistic and demagogic attitude.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lopez Obrador went on to ask Xi for help not with <em>&ldquo;these rude threats, but to ask you for humanitarian reasons to help us by controlling the shipments of fentanyl that may be sent from China to our country.&rdquo;</em> He added that by providing information on fentanyl cargoes, including their expected locations and arrival times, China&rsquo;s government could help Mexican authorities gain <em>&ldquo;greater control&rdquo;</em> over the shipments.</p>

<p>Mexican drug labs reportedly press fentanyl ingredients shipped from overseas, especially China, into pills that are made to resemble regular pharmaceuticals. Republican lawmakers in Washington have blamed the US-Mexico border crisis for a flood of fentanyl shipments into the country, which has caused around 70,000 deaths annually from synthetic opioid overdoses.</p>
<p>However, Lopez Obrador said in his letter to Xi that social decay was driving US demand for fentanyl. <em>&ldquo;I would tell them, for example, to keep their children at home longer. Don&rsquo;t kick them out of the house. Keep them for two or three years more,&rdquo;</em> he advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that only about 30% of the illegal fentanyl consumed in the US is smuggled across the US-Mexico border. <em>&ldquo;Nevertheless, in a deceitful and irresponsible way, some US lawmakers have recently blamed Mexico for the misfortune they suffer in their country due to the use of fentanyl,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Beijing banned fentanyl exports in 2019, a move hailed by then-US president Donald Trump as a potential <em>&ldquo;game changer,&rdquo;</em> but Chinese suppliers have allegedly shipped fentanyl precursor drugs to Mexican cartels. Chinese officials have rejected the US allegations that the cartels are making fentanyl pills with ingredients supplied by China as <em><a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/lcbt/sgfyrbt/202109/t20210903_9031414.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;utterly false.&rdquo;</a></em></p>

            <p>Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the center of an historic criminal indictment against Donald Trump, has been ordered to pay an additional $122,000 in legal fees that the then-president incurred when she sued him unsuccessfully for defamation in 2018.</p>
<p>A federal appellate court in California ruled on the fee dispute on Tuesday, right around the same time that Trump was pleading not guilty in New York City to criminal charges stemming from an alleged $130,000 hush-money payment that was made to Daniels while he was running for president in 2016. Daniels, who claimed to have been threatened to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump, sued the then-president after he dismissed her accusations as a <em>&ldquo;total con job.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The latest court order covers legal fees that Trump ran up in defending against Daniels&rsquo; appeal of a judge&rsquo;s decision to throw out her defamation lawsuit. <a href="https://twitter.com/pnjaban/status/1643331602511011848">Harmeet Dillon</a>, one of the lawyers representing Trump in the defamation case, said Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling brings to more than $600,000 the combined fee awards that her firm has obtained against Daniels.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s lawyers sought reimbursement for his legal fees in 2018, arguing that sanctions were needed to deter a <em>&ldquo;repeat filer of frivolous defamation cases.&rdquo;</em> Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has vowed that she will go to jail before she pays a penny to Trump.</p>
<p>When she was hit with an initial order to pay nearly $300,000 in December 2018, her then-lawyer, Michael Avenatti, claimed that the judgment would <em>&ldquo;never hold up on appeal.&rdquo;</em> Avenatti is now serving a 14-year prison term for defrauding clients and obstructing collection of taxes from his coffee business.</p>
<p>Trump on Tuesday became the first current or former US president arrested on criminal charges. He faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg alleged that Trump falsely reported the hush-money payment to Daniels as a legal expense to cover up his violation of election laws.</p>
<p>Proving that Trump broke election laws would require showing that he paid Daniels solely to help win the 2016 presidential race, thereby exceeding the federal limit for campaign contributions. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley has noted that both the Federal Election Commission and the US Department of Justice found the matter unworthy of pursuing, likely because Trump would have other potential reasons to keep allegations of an affair with Daniels from becoming public.</p>

                            <p><strong>The German chancellor will be investigated for allegedly helping a bank hold onto millions of ill-gotten euros</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will be investigated by parliament for his alleged role in&nbsp;helping the Hamburg-based Warburg Bank avoid repaying $48 million in illegal tax refunds. Scholz has already been probed for his possible links to the affair, and his party insists the latest investigation is politically-motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will request a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the Scholz-Warburg tax affair in the German Bundestag in the first parliamentary week after the Easter vacations,&rdquo;</em> lawmaker Mathias Middelberg of the CDU party said at a press conference on Tuesday. Together with leftist opponents of Scholz, the center-right party has the majority needed to initiate such an investigation.</p>
<p>Scholz has already been questioned by the Hamburg state parliament twice about the affair, and is expected to be summoned back before the regional legislature at some point this spring, Politico reported.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians claim that Scholz used his political influence to persuade Hamburg state authorities to abandon their attempts to claim back &euro;47 million ($48.2 million) in taxes from Warburg Bank in 2016. Scholz was serving as the city&rsquo;s mayor at the time, and met in private with Warburg officials on three separate occasions before the state stopped its pursuit of the money.</p>

<p>Scholz' ties to the&nbsp;scandal surfaced during&nbsp;his 2021 election campaign, but the Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor denied any involvement. He has already been questioned over these meetings, but Middelberg told reporters that the latest probe will examine whether his statements of non-involvement were <em>&ldquo;believable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to a CDU letter seen by Politico, the party recently learned that Scholz readily recounted his meetings with the bank in front of one investigative committee, before claiming to have no recollection in front of others.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This comprehensive memory gap of the chancellor after an initial memory of a concrete meeting &hellip; raises a multitude of questions to be clarified,&rdquo;</em> the letter reportedly states.</p>
<p>The so-called &lsquo;cum-ex&rsquo; scandal was a Europe-wide scheme involving more than a dozen banks and numerous traders and companies who lent each other shares, then falsely reported paying tax on these transfers in order to claim back tax refunds from at least 11 European governments. The German government lost around $30 billion in the scheme, which it has worked to reclaim since the scandal came to light in 2017.</p>
<p>Scholz&rsquo;s party views the probe as politically motivated. In a Twitter post on Tuesday, SPD chief whip Katja Mast declared that the CDU <em>&ldquo;is not interested in knowledge, but party tactics,&rdquo;</em> accusing the party of <em>&ldquo;making claims that have long since been refuted.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Bob Lee, the creator of Cash App and former CTO at Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s payment company Square, was killed in a stabbing in San Francisco, California on Tuesday, according to multiple sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the morning of April 4 at 2:35 am, the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) responded to a report of a stabbing in the city&rsquo;s SoMa district. According to the report on the SFPD&rsquo;s website, officers arrived at the scene to find a 43-year-old male victim suffering from apparent stab wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officers rendered first aid to the man, who was transported to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. However, the victim succumbed to his injuries, the SFPD reported, noting that the department is investigating the incident as a homicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after the incident, NBC Bay Area reported that the victim of the stabbing was Bob Lee. This was later confirmed by MobileCoin, where Lee was serving as chief products officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before joining MobileCoine, Lee worked at Google, helping lead the team that developed the Android platformand working on developing the core library. He subsequently joined Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s payment company Square, later renamed as Block. Lee became the company&rsquo;s first CTO and created the now popular Cash App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lee, also known as &lsquo;Crazy Bob,&rsquo; was also an investor in tech startups. According to his LinkedIn profile, he invested in companies such as SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile, Figma, Faire, Orchid, Addressable, Netswitch and Found, among others.</p>

                            <p><strong>The drug company will offer $8.9bn over 25 years to resolve lawsuits from tens of thousands of alleged victims of its baby powder</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Drug giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has agreed to pay $8.9 billion to settle claims that its talc-based baby powders caused cancer &ndash; a record-setting sum that would nevertheless avoid admitting culpability in tens of thousands of cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has not <em>&ldquo;changed its longstanding position that its talcum powder products are safe,&rdquo;</em> J&amp;J said in a statement on Tuesday. The settlement is merely meant to <em>&ldquo;resolve all the current and future talc claims&rdquo;</em> in a <em>&ldquo;timely manner,&rdquo;</em> it said.</p>
<p>The money will be paid over 25 years via a subsidiary, LTL Management, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to pay for the settlement. J&amp;J&rsquo;s previous efforts to set up LTL as a liability shield to absorb the losses from ongoing talc lawsuits were rejected in court on Friday.</p>

<p>The offer satisfied attorneys for about 70,000 plaintiffs, with lawyer Mikal Watts of Watts Guerra LLC describing it as &ldquo;<em>the culmination of a job well done</em>&rdquo; and arguing the payout would <em>&ldquo;get our clients fairly paid for their injuries.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>However, lawyers for tens of thousands more plaintiffs rejected the sum. Attorneys with Beasley Allen accused J&amp;J of <em>&ldquo;seeking an extremely deep discount on justice,&rdquo;</em> calling the proposed payout <em>&ldquo;woefully inadequate to cover even the current ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims, much less any future claims.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This sham deal does not even pay for most victims&rsquo; medical bills,&rdquo;</em> attorney Jason Itkin of Arnold &amp; Itkin said in a statement on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any settlement out of bankruptcy would require the approval of both a bankruptcy court judge and 75% of the plaintiffs. J&amp;J&rsquo;s offer would be the largest post-bankruptcy product liability settlement on record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J&amp;J stopped selling its talc-based baby powder internationally only just last year, despite the US Food and Drug Administration finding a <em>&ldquo;potential for contamination of talc with asbestos&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a notorious carcinogen. The agency also found <em>&ldquo;a possible association between the use of powders containing talc in the genital area and the incidence of ovarian cancer.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The company already lost nine cases related to its talc products of the 41 that have gone to trial. One high-profile case resulted in a $4.7 billion judgment against J&amp;J, though they were able to reduce the sum to $2.1 billion on appeal and have vowed to take it all the way to the Supreme Court in an effort to have it reversed. It has won, mistrialed, or successfully appealed 32 cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>An estimated one in six people worldwide are unable to conceive, the organization says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Infertility affects one in six people worldwide, the World Health Organization has revealed in a new report. While the WHO could not determine if infertility has increased or decreased, the report comes amid warnings of declining sperm counts worldwide.</p>
<p>Published on Tuesday, the report stated that as of 2022, 17.5% of the global population experienced infertility at some point in their lives. To arrive at that figure, WHO researchers analyzed more than 130 separate studies from 1990 to 2021, and found similar results across the world.</p>
<p>The average lifetime prevalence of infertility in high-income countries was 17.8%, compared to 16.5% in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The report reveals an important truth: infertility does not discriminate,&rdquo;</em> WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. <em>&ldquo;The sheer proportion of people affected shows the need to widen access to fertility care and ensure this issue is no longer sidelined in health research and policy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Dr. Pascale Allotey, director of the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department at the WHO, described the findings as<em> &ldquo;staggering.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Infertility is defined by the WHO as an inability to conceive a child after one year of regular unprotected sex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study did not list any common factors behind the one-in-six figure. However, for both women and men, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity have all been linked to lower fertility. Age plays a role too, with women becoming less fertile from their mid-30s onwards, and male fertility falling from around 40.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also did not identify whether infertility rates have increased or decreased in the time period studied. However, a landmark&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/2/157/6824414?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> published last November found that male sperm counts have fallen by 62% in the last 50 years. Average sperm counts have dropped from 104 to 49 million per milliliter, just above the threshold of 40, below which infertility is likely.</p>
<p>Like the WHO&rsquo;s report, the sperm count study found similar results across different regions. Although it declined to speculate on what was causing the drop, other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/519078-penis-sizes-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> has identified exposure to certain plastics and chemicals as the culprit, alongside the same dietary and lifestyle factors that cause infertility in both genders.</p>

                            <p><strong>The French president has argued that any country helping Russia in its operation against Kiev will be viewed as an “accomplice”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Any nation planning on assisting Russia in its ongoing military campaign in Ukraine should be aware that it will be treated as an &ldquo;<em>accomplice,</em>&rdquo; French President Emmanuel Macron warned while on an official visit to Beijing.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in the Chinese capital on Wednesday, Macron said: &ldquo;<em>We have decided since the beginning of the conflict to help the victim, and we have also made it very clear that anyone helping the aggressor would be an accomplice in breach of international law.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Addressing the French community in Beijing, Macron noted that &ldquo;<em>China, with its close relationship with Russia, which has been reaffirmed in recent days, can play a major role</em>&rdquo; in ceasing the hostilities. The French head of state cited China&rsquo;s opposition to the use of nuclear weapons, as well as the peace plan put forth by Beijing in late February.</p>
<p>Macron went on to argue that Europe &ldquo;<em>must not disassociate</em> [itself], <em>separate</em> [itself] <em>from China</em>&rdquo; economically.</p>

<p>The meeting between Xi and Putin in late March yielded an array of statements, protocols, memoranda and agreements. They ranged from deepening bilateral economic ties and the use of the yuan in foreign trade to &ldquo;<em>joint maritime and air patrols and joint</em> [military] <em>exercise.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Russian head of state also lauded Beijing&rsquo;s twelve-step peace plan, adding, however, that Ukraine and its Western backers are not willing to discuss peace at this point.</p>
<p>Relations between China and Russia are &ldquo;<em>at their highest point in history,</em>&rdquo; Putin declared during the talks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in late February, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price expressed concern over the fact that Beijing and Moscow &ldquo;<em>share a vision,</em>&rdquo; adding that Washington believes the Chinese leadership has not ruled out providing Russia with military aid.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has echoed the allegation, which Beijing has consistently denied.</p>

                            <p><strong>An event in Poznan was scrapped to prevent Russian athletes from competing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Poland will not host the women&rsquo;s foil World Cup, after the International Fencing Federation (FIE) decided to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete as neutrals.</p>
<p>The decision to scrap the event, which was scheduled to take place on April 21-23 in the city of Poznan, was announced by the Polish Fencing Federation (PZS) on Wednesday. It said in a statement it had been &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do so after the FIE refused to allow it to screen participants.</p>
<p>The selection procedure that the international sports body intended to have in place would have resulted in Ukrainian athletes not participating and posed <em>&ldquo;a risk that a large number of competitors with Russian and Belarusian passports [would] be admitted in a poorly controlled manner,&rdquo;</em> the Polish organization said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Polish Fencing Association supports the Ukrainian Fencing Federation (FFU) in its efforts to remove from the competitions and the world fencing environment people who support the brutal war in Ukraine and endorse the regime of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,&rdquo;</em> it stated.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian government has objected to bringing athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international events, since the International Olympic Committee in January recommended their return under a neutral flag. The IOC&rsquo;s previous blanket ban was deemed discriminatory.</p>
<p>The FIE announced its decision to readmit Russian and Belarusian fencers last month. This opened the door for them to qualify for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. The FFU condemned the move.</p>
<p>Last week, the Ukrainian Sports Ministry issued a blanket ban on the country&rsquo;s athletes participating in any Olympics qualification events, in which Russian or Belarusian citizens compete.</p>
<p>Sporting bodies in certain other Western countries have previously announced scrapping fencing events for similar reasons as in Poland. Germany&rsquo;s DFB canceled a women&rsquo;s foil World Cup event a week after the FIE&rsquo;s change of rules. Its French counterpart (FFE) did the same with the men&rsquo;s Challenge Monal epee tournament last Friday. Both parts of the fencing World Cup were scheduled for May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Fresh demonstrations have been announced after talks between the government and trade unions ended in failure</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>French trade unions called for record turnout at protests on Thursday, after negotiations with the government over a controversial pension reform bill broke down. France has been consumed by protests and riots since President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s government hiked the retirement age without a vote in parliament.</p>
<p>Union representatives met with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Wednesday, warning beforehand that they would walk out if Borne refused to entertain the idea of bringing the retirement age for most workers back to 62 from 64. Borne refused, and the union representatives walked out, calling for strikes and mass demonstrations the following day.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We again told the prime minister that the only democratic outcome could be the text&rsquo;s withdrawal,&rdquo;</em> Cyril Chabanier, who heads the CFTC union, told reporters. <em>&ldquo;The prime minister replied that she wished to maintain the text, a grave decision.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We decided to put an end to this useless meeting,&rdquo;</em> the leader of the CGT union, Sophie Binet, added. <em>&ldquo;The prime minister has chosen to send us back to the streets.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Borne passed the text in question last month, invoking special constitutional powers to enact the pension reform legislation without a parliamentary vote. Raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 has long been a project of President Emmanuel Macron, who described the move as a <em>&ldquo;just and responsible&rdquo;</em> way to keep France&rsquo;s social security system afloat.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s passage triggered an immediate wave of demonstrations and riots, with the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573502-france-protest-pension-macron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest protest</a> drawing more than a million people into the streets across the country. Marches in Paris and some other cities turned violent, with black-clad rioters setting fires, smashing storefronts, and hurling rocks at police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The union chiefs called for similar turnout on Thursday. <em>&ldquo;We have to continue mobilizing until the end, until the government understands there is no way out other than withdrawing this reform,&rdquo;</em> Binet told the AFP news agency. <em>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t move on to anything else until this reform is repealed.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The bill is currently being examined by France&rsquo;s Constitutional Council, which will issue a verdict on its legality next week. While the council can strike down or amend parts of the text, it rarely tosses entire bills.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Ukraine conflict will not end by military means so President Zelensky is preparing to sue for peace, retired general Waldemar Skrzypczak has claimed</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is visiting Poland to prepare a <em>&ldquo;diplomatic coalition&rdquo;</em> for eventual peace talks with Russia, retired Polish general Waldemar Skrzypczak has claimed. He argued that Kiev cannot achieve its aims on the battlefield, and will need Western support for negotiations with Moscow.</p>
<p>Skrzypczak was speaking to the Rzeczpospolita newspaper on Wednesday, as Zelensky arrived in Warsaw to meet senior officials. The former commander of the Polish Land Forces rejected the idea that Ukraine should use Western weapons for a last-ditch offensive against Russia &ndash; a scenario reportedly being pressed upon Kiev by its foreign backers.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Pushing the Ukrainians into an offensive is unjustified at the moment, because they are not ready for it. Now it&rsquo;s time for politicians,&rdquo;</em> Skrzypczak argued.</p>
<p>The retired general believes that <em>&ldquo;neither side has an advantage&rdquo;</em> on the battlefield and that there is <em>&ldquo;no chance of a military end to [the conflict].&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Polish government is among the most vocal supporters of Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia. Zelensky has traveled to the country to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, among other officials.</p>
<p>Warsaw has described the occasion as the first <em>&ldquo;official&rdquo;</em> visit by the Ukrainian leader since hostilities escalated in February 2022, even though Zelensky previously passed through Poland on his way to the US and the UK. According to Warsaw, the trip demonstrates Poland&rsquo;s important international role.</p>

<p>Publicly, the US and other Western nations have pledged to assist Ukraine <em>&ldquo;for as long as it takes&rdquo;</em> to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. Kiev has vowed not to negotiate with Moscow until Ukrainian forces have regained control of all its former territories, including Crimea. Moscow has repeatedly said it is open to talks with Kiev on condition that it recognizes <em>&ldquo;the reality on the ground.&rdquo;</em> That includes the new status of four former Ukrainian regions which voted overwhelmingly to join Russia last autumn.</p>
<p>Skrzypczak, who resigned his command under then-President Lech Kaczynski in 2009 but went on to hold several roles in the Polish Defense Ministry, predicted that Ukraine&rsquo;s chances of a military victory in the long run would be undermined by a dwindling level of foreign support.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The West is slowly getting tired of the war, and voters that support aiding Ukraine are getting smaller in numbers. That is why it is necessary to build a front of support for Ukraine so that it has a strong voice in future talks,&rdquo;</em> he explained.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Iranian air defenses downed a drone that was approaching a military compound in Isfahan province on Tuesday night, the news agency Tasnim has reported. The facility did not suffer any damage as a result of the attack, according to the outlet.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in the same province as the January 28 drone strike on a military &ldquo;<em>workshop</em>&rdquo; in the city of Isfahan, the capital of the eponymous province. In February, the Iranian authorities revealed having arrested the individuals suspected of being behind that strike. Officials in Tehran claimed that the alleged culprits of the January strike were acting on orders from Israel.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Iran&rsquo;s Ministry of Intelligence and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an influential branch of Tehran&rsquo;s armed forces, warned the Jewish state that it would receive a &ldquo;<em>lesson to remember.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>On the day after the January attack, the Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous US officials and other &ldquo;<em>people familiar with the operation,</em>&rdquo; also alleged that Israel was behind the act of sabotage.</p>
<p>Three explosives-laden drones had reportedly approached the military facility. According to the Iranian Defense Ministry, one of the UAVs was shot down by air defenses, while the other two crashed into a protective mesh above the complex.</p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s state-run IRNA media outlet quoted defense officials at the time as saying that &ldquo;<em>this unsuccessful attack did not cause any loss of life and caused minor damage to the workshop&rsquo;s roof.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In keeping with Israel&rsquo;s usual policy of silence about such operations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Criminal charges brought against former US President Donald Trump undermine the public&rsquo;s faith in the justice system, Senator Mitt Romney said on Tuesday. He argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg overstepped his mandate in handling the case.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges during his arraignment in a Manhattan court.</p>
<p>He surrendered for arrest immediately before being arraigned, but was released from the courthouse the same day.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I believe President Trump&rsquo;s character and conduct make him unfit for office. Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda,&rdquo; </em>Romney, a senator from Utah and the Republican Party&rsquo;s presidential candidate in 2012, said in a statement on his website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The prosecutor&rsquo;s overreach sets a dangerous precedent for criminalizing political opponents and damages the public&rsquo;s faith in our justice system.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romney said the jury will examine the evidence in Trump&rsquo;s case, but <em>&ldquo;the American voters will ultimately render their own judgment on the former President&rsquo;s political future.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the indictment by a grand jury, Trump falsified business records when authorizing then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to make a $130,000 hush money payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had sex with Trump in 2006 when he was already married to his current wife, Melania. The alleged payment took place when Trump was a candidate in the 2016 presidential election that he eventually won.</p>
<p>Trump denied having an affair with Daniels and claimed that he was unaware of any payments made to her. He insists that the prosecution is politically motivated.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&rdquo;</em> Trump said in a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He added that<em> &ldquo;this fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Trump failed to secure a second term in 2020 after losing to Joe Biden. He formally launched his bid for the 2024 election in November and has held several campaign rallies across the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Muslims had flocked to the Al-Aqsa Mosque after Jewish ultranationalists called for the ritual slaughter of a goat in the compound. The ancient practice is currently banned by Israeli authorities to preserve the fragile status quo, though this has not stopped some Jewish worshippers from insisting on performing the sacrifice inside the mosque.</p>
<p>Overnight, at least nine missiles were fired from Gaza, most of which were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. In response, Israel unleashed airstrikes on what it described as Hamas training camps in Gaza.</p>
<p>The Palestinian administration condemned the storming of the mosque by Israeli security forces as a crime that &ldquo;<em>exceeds all red lines and will lead to a large explosion.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have also strongly criticized Israel&rsquo;s use of force at the holy site, arguing that it undermines peace efforts in the region.</p>

                            <p><strong>The nation can no longer take peace for granted, Keiji Furuya has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Japan could pass a bill facilitating the rollout of bomb shelters as early as next fiscal year, Keiji Furuya, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Japan hasn&rsquo;t been involved in a war for 77 years, but what we&rsquo;ve taken for granted since then no longer holds true,&rdquo;</em> Furuya, a former head of the National Public Safety Commission and co-leader of a group of MPs lobbying for the measure, said in an interview with Bloomberg News published on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;The world has changed a lot,&rdquo;</em> Furuya explained.</p>
<p>Just 4% of the sites designated as bomb shelters in Japan are located underground, according to Kyodo News.</p>
<p>According to Furuya, a bill outlining a schedule for shelter provision could be passed as soon as next fiscal year. The initiative comes amid increasing tension between Tokyo and Beijing, as well as between Beijing and the US, Japan&rsquo;s ally.</p>

<p>Last year, Japan delivered a diplomatic protest to China after claiming that several ballistic missiles fired by the Chinese military during an exercise around Taiwan fell in the waters within Japan&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said at the time that the drill was conducted in accordance with international law.</p>
<p>North Korea drastically ramped up missile tests in 2022, with some projectiles landing close to Japanese territory. Pyongyang has maintained that the tests were a response to joint US-South Korean drills.</p>
<p>In February, Japanese legislators approved a record $50 billion defense budget, citing new security challenges. The government has also revised the country&rsquo;s national security strategy to include the acquisition of <em>&ldquo;counterstrike capability&rdquo;</em> with the aim of pre-empting enemy attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a meeting in January, US and Japanese officials pledged to increase military exercises and boost defense cooperation. Tokyo and Washington regularly conduct naval and ground-based drills, including maneuvers focused on amphibious assault and anti-submarine warfare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Washington announced the move alongside a new $2.6 billion weapons package for Kiev</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Pentagon has said it is preparing to expand&nbsp;its training of Ukrainian forces, noting the instruction would focus on different types of weapons and maneuvers. While the US has sought to accelerate its shipment of Abrams main battle tanks to Kiev, training on that platform has yet to begin.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking to reporters for a background briefing on Tuesday, a senior defense official <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3351824/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing-on-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that in addition to a newly approved weapons package worth more than $2.6 billion, Washington has also <em>&ldquo;expanded US-led training&rdquo;</em> to focus on <em>&ldquo;combined arms and joint maneuver operations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Though the official provided few details on the new training, they noted that 4,000 Ukrainian troops had recently completed instruction on the US-made Bradley fighting vehicle and the Stryker armored personnel carrier, both of which have been supplied to Kiev. Since fighting with Russia&nbsp;began last year, the Pentagon has trained more than 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers in total, many of them in Germany, the official added.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong></strong>However, asked about training for the M1 Abrams tank &ndash; which Washington has also agreed to ship to Ukraine despite initial reluctance &ndash; the official said it had not even started, as the military is <em>&ldquo;still working on the equipment procurement.&rdquo;</em> They could not provide an exact timeline for when it might begin, but hoped it could move forward <em>&ldquo;relatively soon.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>After initially refusing to send battle tanks, President Joe Biden reversed course earlier this year when Germany said it would provide its own Leopard tanks, opting to ship 31 units. Deliveries were originally set to take up to two years, prompting the Pentagon to again change course and offer an older variant of the same weapon, which could now reach the battlefield by the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The&nbsp;US has also instructed Ukrainian troops on a variety of other weapons systems &ndash; including the Patriot missile defense battery <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/03/22/us-military-offers-first-glimpse-of-training-ukrainian-troops-america.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on US territory</a> &ndash; and held <em>&ldquo;combined-arms&rdquo;</em> training at bases in Germany.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The new <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3350958/biden-administration-announces-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weapons package</a> announced in conjunction with the expanded&nbsp;training includes additional artillery rounds, rockets, missiles and other ammunition, 30mm gun trucks, grenade launchers, and Javelin anti-tank systems. The aid brought total US military assistance to Ukraine to nearly $36 billion since Biden took office in 2021.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Despite vast sums of money and weapons donated to Ukrainian forces, multiple training programs hosted by the US military, and Western intelligence support offered to Kiev, American officials continue to insist Washington is not a participant in the conflict. Moscow has repeatedly warned against foreign arms shipments to Ukraine, arguing they would not deter its military aims and only prolong the fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s unclear what kind of&nbsp;response the officials will&nbsp;consider, the planned meeting comes amid soaring tensions with the DPRK, which has conducted a large number of weapons tests in retaliation for continued US-led military drills with South Korea in recent months. Pyongyang has repeatedly denounced the exercises as rehearsal for an invasion, and insists on its right to develop its nuclear arsenal to defend against potential attack.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Under President Joe Biden, Washington has pursued a more bellicose approach to North Korea than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who arranged several rare diplomatic meetings with leader Kim Jong-un. Biden has instead demanded that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons, which the North has rejected as a non-starter.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The US State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-special-representative-for-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-sung-kim-to-meet-republic-of-korea-and-japanese-counterparts/?utm_source=miragenews&amp;utm_medium=miragenews&amp;utm_campaign=news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Biden&rsquo;s special representative for North Korea, Sung Kim, would attend Friday&rsquo;s nuclear talks, arguing that ties with Japan and South Korea are <em>&ldquo;critical to strengthening regional security.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>The former president claims he has been targeted with a long list of “fake” allegations since his 2016 election win</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>In a speech from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, former US President Donald Trump railed against New York prosecutors after pleading not guilty to 34 criminal counts, also accusing Democrats of political persecution and <em>&ldquo;fraudulent investigations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Trump delivered the address to a live audience on Tuesday night, insisting there is <em>&ldquo;no case&rdquo;</em> against him after returning home from New York, where he was arraigned on charges of falsifying business records earlier in the day.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I never thought anything like this could happen in America... The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Trump said, claiming that the latest case is part of an <em>&ldquo;onslaught of fraudulent investigations&rdquo;</em> brought by Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump argued that since his rivals <em>&ldquo;can&rsquo;t beat us at the ballot box,&rdquo;</em> they have tried to <em>&ldquo;beat us through the law,&rdquo;</em> reiterating some of his previous allegations of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential race. He rejected the charges against him as <em>&ldquo;fake,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;arguing that their purpose is to <em>&ldquo;interfere with the upcoming 2024 election,&rdquo;</em> and should be <em>&ldquo;dropped immediately.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Taking the tone of a presidential candidate, the former leader went on to fire a litany of criticisms at Democrats and President Joe Biden, slamming them for high inflation <em>&ldquo;crippling&rdquo;</em> the US economy, <em>&ldquo;raging crime statistics,&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;open borders&rdquo;</em> immigration policies. He warned that Biden could lead the country into <em>&ldquo;an all-out nuclear World War III,&rdquo;</em> apparently referring to US involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Manhattan District Attorney&rsquo;s office has accused Trump of arranging a hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to keep her from going public about an alleged affair, and later attempting to cover up the transfer through falsified records. Prosecutors also claim he knowingly tried to conceal other crimes using falsified documents, providing a basis for felony charges rather than misdemeanors.</p>
<p>Trump has denied all wrongdoing, calling the indictment a <em>&ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;political persecution&rdquo;</em> by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who he described as a <em>&ldquo;radical left George Soros-backed prosecutor&rdquo;</em> during his speech on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The DA&rsquo;s office has said it expects to produce most of its evidence for discovery in the next 65 days, while Trump&rsquo;s defense has until early August to file any motions against the case. Though Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled the next in-person hearing for December 4, attorneys for Trump say they hope to get the case dismissed before it can go to trial.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The former US president has been arraigned in New York on 34 criminal charges, marking a potentially dark new chapter in US politics </strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Donald Trump made history on Tuesday as the first former US president to be arrested on criminal charges. The ex-reality TV star traveled to New York City to plead not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>
<aside class="listicle"></aside>
<h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>The 76-year-old Trump surrendered for arrest at a courthouse in Lower Manhattan after a grand jury voted last week to indict him for allegedly falsifying business records. After being fingerprinted, he was ushered into the courtroom for arraignment by Judge Juan Merchan. Flanked by his lawyers and showing little emotion, he firmly answered <em>&ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;</em> when asked how he pleaded.</p>
<p>Trump was then released, and he ignored questions from reporters as he left the courthouse. He was brought in and out of a building through a door out of view from protesters, who were confined to a park across the street. Trump reportedly flew back to his home at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was expected to deliver remarks to supporters on Tuesday night.</p>
<aside class="listicle"></aside>
<h4>What happens next?</h4>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s next court hearing is scheduled for December 4, where Merchan may rule on legal motions in the case. For instance, Trump&rsquo;s lawyers will almost certainly file a motion to dismiss the case. It&rsquo;s not clear whether the former president will have to attend the next hearing.</p>
<p>Trump will continue to run for president in the 2024 election. The Republican primary season kicks off just two months after his next court hearing. While the law doesn&rsquo;t prohibit him from being a presidential candidate, even as he faces criminal charges, the case could disrupt his campaign. However, polling shows that the indictment will boost his popularity among Republican voters, at least temporarily. Twitter owner Elon Musk predicted last month that Trump would win the 2024 election <em>&ldquo;in a landslide&rdquo;</em> if the Democrats dared to indict him.&nbsp;</p>
<aside class="listicle"></aside>
<h4>What is the case about?</h4>
<p>The indictment stems from a $130,000 hush money payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, when Trump was on the way to winning that year&rsquo;s presidential election. The payment itself wasn&rsquo;t illegal. The US Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission declined to pursue the matter as a campaign finance violation, which would have been based on the notion that the payment was made solely for the purpose of aiding Trump&rsquo;s election prospects.</p>
<p>However, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who campaigned for office on a pledge to prosecute Trump, has pursued the case based on allegations that Trump didn&rsquo;t properly report the hush money expense on his business records. The DA has accused Trump of falsely reporting the cost as a payment for legal services. <em>&ldquo;The evidence will show he did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election,&rdquo;</em> Bragg claimed on Tuesday. Presumably, these would be the same alleged offenses that federal authorities found unworthy of pursuing.</p>
<p>The indictment also cited allegations of a $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed that the billionaire developer fathered a child out of wedlock, as well as a $150,000 payment to a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump. The former president has denied all wrongdoing and called the case against him a political<em> &ldquo;witch hunt.&rdquo;</em></p>
<aside class="listicle"></aside>
<h4>What are the repercussions?</h4>
<p>The indictment marks a new era in American politics. It&rsquo;s not only the first indictment of a former president, but also a criminal prosecution of the opposition party&rsquo;s leading candidate (at the moment) in the upcoming presidential election. Arresting political opponents is the stuff of banana republics, many observers have argued.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Today is a bad day for all of us, and we are all going to regret it for a very long time,&rdquo;</em> Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, <a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1643285352294100993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;Today, American politics crosses a line that it&rsquo;s never going to come back from.&rdquo;</em> He warned that the indictment will embolden prosecutors around the country to go after rival politicians to make names for themselves. Democrats, such as President Joe Biden, won&rsquo;t be immune from such tactics.</p>
<p>Trump called his arrest <em>&ldquo;surreal,&rdquo;</em> adding that he <em>&ldquo;can&rsquo;t believe this is happening in America.&rdquo;</em> He could face even more legal troubles, including possible indictments by Biden&rsquo;s Department of Justice related to his handling of classified documents and his alleged incitement of the US Capitol riot. He also faces an investigation in Georgia for alleged meddling in Fulton County&rsquo;s 2020 election results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The military branch has reportedly raised its body fat limits for new enlistees amid struggles to meet recruiting quotas</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Air Force has reportedly opted to help ease its recruiting struggles by allowing fatter Americans to join the military branch, making potentially millions of obese young people eligible to enlist.</p>
<p>Under the new guidelines, male recruits will be allowed to carry up to 26% body fat, while females will have a limit of 36% body fat, <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/04/04/air-force-will-allow-more-body-fat-recruits-service-struggles-find-new-airmen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Military.com</a> reported on Tuesday, citing US Air Force Recruiting Service spokeswoman Leslie Brown. The previous limits were 20% for males and 28% for females.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stress enough, we are not lowering our standards,&rdquo;</em> Brown said. Rather, the Air Force is <em>&ldquo;aligning&rdquo;</em> its rules with a Pentagon directive issued last year. That <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodi/130803p.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy document</a> required that all service members maintain a level of fitness and body composition to successfully perform all of their duties.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/tools-calculators/percent-body-fat-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Council on Exercise</a> classifies men with body fat percentages of 25 and higher as obese. The obese category begins at 32% for women. Allowing obese recruits will open up the Air Force to a huge pool of potential enlistees. An estimated 39.8% of Americans ages 20 to 39 are obese, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html#:~:text=The%20obesity%20prevalence%20was%2039.8,adults%20aged%2060%20and%20older." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>

<p>The US Army and Navy have tried to help address their recruiting woes by offering physical fitness preparatory courses &ndash; called pre-boot camp in the Army&rsquo;s case &ndash; to give prospects who exceed body fat limits a chance to get in good enough shape to enlist.</p>
<p>The Air Force has estimated that it will be able to recruit an additional 50 to 100 new enlistees each month under its revised body fat limits. The new hires will later need to pass standard fitness tests, including a requirement for waist-to-height ratio, to stay in the Air Force.</p>
<p>Of the 34 million Americans in Generation Z &ndash; those born after 1997 &ndash; nearly 71%, are ineligible for military service, most commonly because of obesity, according to 2017 Pentagon data. Other common disqualifying factors include medical conditions, criminal records, drug use and failure to earn a high school diploma.</p>

<p>The Air Force has estimated that it will miss its recruiting goal for this year by around 10%, even after taking various steps to attract more enlistees. For instance, it eased rules to allow recruits with neck and hand tattoos, and it launched a program to give those who test positive for THC a chance to retest. Recruiting bonuses include up to $65,000 in student loan repayment.</p>

                            <p><strong>Washington is used to controlling the planet’s top tech companies and doesn’t want anyone to threaten its surveillance domination</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>As the United States contemplates a possible ban on TikTok, it relentlessly accuses Beijing of using the popular Chinese-owned social media application as a means of espionage, claiming that the Communist Party has access to user data.</p>
<p>Ironically, Washington itself is known to be doing exactly what US politicians are accusing China of doing. Using the unique advantage of having jurisdiction over the world&rsquo;s top internet companies, the US has given itself the right to look into the private communications of foreign citizens anywhere in the world. Combine that data-sharing between intelligence agencies of the US and its allies, and you get the most comprehensive espionage regime in the world.</p>
<p>While American politicians and media constantly talk about fears of Chinese espionage, the near-absence of coverage of Washington&rsquo;s own spying efforts ought to be a reminder of where the true power lies. When it comes to the shady activities of the CIA and the NSA, the public tends to only learn what they did years later from declassified documents, or what they <em>&ldquo;have been doing all along&rdquo;</em> from rare whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. All discussion and speculation about what they &ldquo;<em>may be doing right now&rdquo;</em> tends to be dismissed as conspiracy theories. Conversely, allegations of Chinese spying activities are constantly explained as &ldquo;<em>we all know they&rsquo;re doing it&rdquo;</em> in the public eye, despite the lack of solid proof.</p>

<p>These warning signs remind us that the most cryptic source of all spying in the world is not China, but the US. Since the Second World War, the US has, in conjunction with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, maintained a worldwide spying regime known as the &lsquo;Five Eyes&rsquo; which, in the age of mass communications, has been designed so that each government can bypass its own privacy laws and judicial restraints in order to spy on each other&rsquo;s citizens, while supplying information within the group. In doing so, they have created a number of communication interception and surveillance programs, as revealed by Snowden, such as PRISM, ECHELON, XKEYSCORE, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, the US nearly holds a monopoly over the means of information and data gathering &ndash; definitely more so than any other country. This is because it has the privilege of having the world&rsquo;s most dominant internet companies located on its own soil, such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Meta. These organizations are required by law to share data with the US government and authorities should they request it. But the US has also gone even further, as revealed by the Washington Post in 2020, the CIA had secretly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired</a> a Swiss cryptography company and used it to rig those machines to be able to spy on all who used them.</p>
<p>In pursuing its comprehensive spying regime, the US has been keeping an eye on friend and foe alike. This has included wiretapping the chancellor of Germany, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-security-agency-spied-merkel-other-top-european-officials-through-danish-2021-05-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coordinating</a> with the intelligence services of other countries to undermine their commercial interests, such as Denmark and the Eurofighter program, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>And yet, American lawmakers suggest that you should truly be scared of TikTok, even as they prepare to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allows US intelligence agencies to spy on foreign citizens&rsquo; phones and online communications without a warrant. Legalized in 2008, Section 702 needs to be reauthorized every few years lest it lapses under a sunset clause. Congress extended it in 2012 and again in 2018 and there&rsquo;s little reason to believe it will fail to do so again before the next deadline, set for December this year.</p>

<p>The real problem Washington has with TikTok is not the alleged spying for Beijing&rsquo;s benefit &ndash; it&rsquo;s the fact that TikTok is the first global-spanning social media network of its magnitude that isn&rsquo;t under US control &ndash; and thus, cannot be weaponized by the US for <em>its own</em> espionage. As such, it weakens the global surveillance regime built up by the US, which is, perhaps, the principal motivation behind Washington&rsquo;s obsession with keeping control of <em>&ldquo;the future of the internet&rdquo;</em> out of Beijing&rsquo;s hands. It&rsquo;s more than a matter of spy games &ndash; it&rsquo;s a matter of hegemony, and as such, it&rsquo;s pure projection on Washington&rsquo;s part to sound the alarm over TikTok&rsquo;s alleged breaches of privacy.</p>
<p>As it stands, the US has an unrivaled digital spying network and is the greatest single threat to individual privacy online. If major internet companies are not owned or controlled by Washington or its closest allies, then the privacy of individuals around the world is increased, not decreased. The US has never been apologetic or open about how it monitors the communications of billions of people. Even if one has their suspicions about China, how can Washington&rsquo;s claims about TikTok, and the motives behind the mounting pressure on the social media platform, be taken at face value?&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The meeting reportedly focused on ensuring ‘appropriate safeguards’ exist around popular tech like ChatGPT</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden summoned the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on Tuesday to discuss the &ldquo;<em>risks and opportunities</em>&rdquo; inherent in artificial intelligence. While the president stopped short of calling AI dangerous, he urged tech companies to put in place safety measures to prevent it from causing harm, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public</em>,&rdquo; Biden said. When pressed by a reporter about whether AI was actually dangerous, however, he backed off, responding, &ldquo;<em>It remains to be seen. Could be</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While AI can assist humans in addressing &ldquo;<em>very difficult challenges like disease and climate change</em>,&rdquo; Biden said, &ldquo;<em>it also has to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The purpose of the meeting, according to a White House statement, was to &ldquo;<em>discuss the importance of protecting rights and safety to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards</em>.&rdquo; The president also reportedly called for Congress to pass privacy legislation limiting the collection of personal data, banning advertising directed at children, and prioritizing health and safety in product development.</p>
<p>Last week, the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy asked the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit ChatGPT developer OpenAI from issuing new commercial releases of GPT-4, the engine powering the popular chatbot, calling the software &ldquo;<em>biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tech ethics group pointed out that the large language model not only exposed users&rsquo; private chat histories to other users, but that researchers were able to commandeer the accounts of strangers, peeking at their chat histories and even accessing their billing data without them knowing.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 tech executives, AI researchers, and other experts in the field signed an open letter last month demanding a six-month moratorium on &ldquo;<em>giant AI experiments</em>&rdquo; until governments and developers could work out a set of shared safety protocols and controls to prevent the rapidly evolving technology from taking charge of its own destiny in a potentially civilization-ending catastrophe.</p>
<p>Italy banned ChatGPT last month, citing privacy concerns, and a Belgian widow recently came forward blaming an open-source ChatGPT competitor for her husband&rsquo;s suicide after he developed a relationship with it. The US has yet to impose any binding restrictions on the development of AI.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The British boxing team has confirmed that it won&rsquo;t participate in the upcoming world championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, at least partly because squads from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to compete in the tournament.</p>
<p>GB Boxing issued a <a href="https://www.gbboxing.org.uk/2023/04/04/statement-from-gb-boxing-on-the-forthcoming-2023-iba-mens-world-boxing-championships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Tuesday, taking issue with a ruling by the International Boxing Association (IBA) to allow teams from Russia and Belarus to compete under their national flags. That decision <em>&ldquo;contravenes&rdquo;</em> the position of the International Olympic Committee, which has called for international sport federations to restrict Russian and Belarusian athletes to competing only as neutral individuals, the UK team said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;GB Boxing condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has solidarity with the people, boxers, coaches and officials of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> the statement said. The team added that its decision to skip the world championships also reflects <em>&ldquo;concerns about the future of boxing&rsquo;s place on the Olympic program.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>However, GB Boxing went on to say that it will be competing in upcoming tournaments in Finland, T&uuml;rkiye, and the Czech Republic. The UK team also boycotted the IBA-organized women&rsquo;s world championships last month in New Delhi. The men&rsquo;s competition is scheduled to run from April 30 through May 14 in Tashkent.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;GB Boxing is committed to delivering the best possible preparation for our boxers in the build-up to Paris 2024 and will continue to work with national federations and tournament organizers to provide training and competition opportunities in advance of the Olympic qualifying events that begin in June 2023 with the European Games in Poland,&rdquo;</em> the statement said.</p>
<p>The IBA&rsquo;s decision not to ban the Russian and Belarusian teams has <em>&ldquo;put further distance between the IBA and the Olympic movement,&rdquo;</em> GB Boxing said. The team added that the IBA was already facing pressure from the IOC to resolve <em>&ldquo;significant, longstanding issues over sporting integrity, governance, transparency and financial management&rdquo;</em> in order to <em>&ldquo;protect boxing&rsquo;s place on the Olympic program.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Finland has forfeited its role in international affairs, becoming yet another “minor” member of the US-led bloc, Russia says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Helsinki&rsquo;s decision to join the NATO alliance will have a<em> &ldquo;negative effect&rdquo;</em> on its ties with Russia, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. On Tuesday, Finland finalized its accession process, becoming the 31st member of the US-led military bloc.</p>
<p>The move will inevitably invoke Moscow&rsquo;s response, the ministry said, adding that Russia continues to see the bloc&rsquo;s expansion as a direct threat to its national security interests.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As we have warned on multiple occasions, the Russian Federation will have to respond with military-technical, as well as other measures in order to address national security threats arising from Finland joining NATO,&rdquo;</em> the ministry said in a statement.<br /><br />So far, Moscow has refrained from announcing any concrete steps it will take in response to Finland&rsquo;s NATO accession. The response will depend <em>&ldquo;on the specific terms on which Finland joins NATO, including the deployment of NATO&rsquo;s military infrastructure and offensive weapons on its territory,&rdquo;</em> the ministry explained.</p>

<p>The latest expansion of the bloc has greatly damaged the security situation in the whole of Northern Europe, which for decades <em>&ldquo;used to be one of the most stable regions in the world,&rdquo;</em> the ministry went on. <em>&ldquo;The line of contact between NATO and the Russian Federation&rsquo;s border has more than doubled,&rdquo;</em> it added, referring to the length of direct land borders between Russia and NATO&rsquo;s member-states.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Helsinki&rsquo;s move has done harm to Finland&rsquo;s own international stance, Russian diplomats asserted. By joining NATO, Finland &ldquo;<em>has given up on its unique identity and lost its independence,&rdquo;</em> forfeiting the <em>&ldquo;special status in international affairs&rdquo;</em> stemming from its decades-long policy of non alignment.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Finland became a minor NATO member without the possibility to influence any decisions. It has lost its ability to have a say in international affairs,&rdquo;</em> the ministry concluded. <em>&ldquo;Make no mistake, Finland&rsquo;s accession to NATO will have a negative effect on the bilateral relations between Russia and Finland.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Hungary has once again objected to the US-led bloc including Kiev in a meeting</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>Inviting Kiev to Brussels over Budapest&rsquo;s explicit objections violates NATO&rsquo;s principles, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Tuesday. He took part in the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Committee anyway, to raise the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We came here in hope that no one will question the validity of our earlier joint decision that NATO is not a part of the war taking place in our neighbor [Ukraine] and that everything must be done to prevent a direct NATO-Russia conflict,&rdquo;</em> Szijjarto said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/szijjarto.peter.official/posts/pfbid02yh7hHL39EMTmWjJvUooBFjS376ErRku77rmSExoici2AYxFjDrW9gvKh62ozJuw2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, posting from the foreign minister conference of bloc members.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Inviting Ukraine <em>&ldquo;violates the principle of the unity of the allies within NATO, but in the spirit of constructiveness we will participate in the meeting,&rdquo;</em> he added. <em>&ldquo;I will also make it clear that Hungary will support any integration efforts of Ukraine only if the Ukrainians restore to Transcarpathian Hungarians the rights they had before 2015.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Around 150,000 ethnic Hungarians live in modern Ukraine, mainly in the Transcarpathian Region. Budapest has vowed not to give up on them <em>&ldquo;under any circumstances,&rdquo;</em> even though there has been pressure from <em>&ldquo;both sides of the Atlantic&rdquo;</em> to do so, Szijjarto had said <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573376-hungary-ukraine-minority-rights/">earlier this month</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Hungary will not support Ukraine&rsquo;s applications to either the EU or NATO so long as Kiev&rsquo;s laws threaten Hungarian-language schools, the minister repeated <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573581-hungary-ukraine-nato-eu-bids/">last week</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Ukraine&rsquo;s crackdown on Russian-speakers, begun by the government installed by the US-backed coup in 2014, has also affected Hungarian, Romanian, and Polish minorities. Romania had previously joined Hungary in demanding linguistic protections for around 400,000 ethnic Romanians and Moldovans, but Bucharest has been silent as of late.</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to Szijjarto, Ukraine had made promises to Hungary for years, but did nothing to address the matter. Despite criticism from the Council of Europe, Kiev has only doubled down on legislation mandating the use of Ukrainian at all levels of education.</p>
<p><strong></strong>NATO procedures require a consensus of members, but the joint commission with Ukraine was set up over Hungary&rsquo;s objections. The US-led bloc has given Kiev billions of dollars worth of military aid over the past year, but continues to insist it is not actually involved in the conflict with Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Norway has followed Brussels’ lead since the bloc began targeting the Russian economy</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Norway has imposed a set of sanctions on Russia that directly mirrors the EU&rsquo;s tenth package of economic penalties. While the Norwegian government insists that this policy is harming the Russian economy, Oslo has also paid a price.</p>
<p>The latest set of sanctions was announced by the Norwegian government on Tuesday, five weeks after a near-identical package of sanctions was imposed by the EU. Norway&rsquo;s new penalties blacklist 87 Russian individuals and 34 entities, forbid the import of several raw materials from Russia, and forbid the trade of &ldquo;dual use goods,&rdquo; a term used to denote technology and components with both civilian and military applications.</p>
<p>Every successive sanctions package imposed by the EU has been aped by Norway with slight alterations. Despite Norway not being a member of the EU, Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said that copying Brussels&rsquo; sanctions demonstrated <em>&ldquo;a strong and clear European response to Russia&rsquo;s war of aggression in Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The sanctions are having an impact on the Russian economy and preventing key inputs from reaching the Russian war industry,&rdquo;</em> Huitfeldt stated.</p>
<p>The EU&rsquo;s sanctions, particularly its embargo on Russian fossil fuel imports, have thrown the bloc into a crisis of spiraling inflation and record energy costs. Meanwhile, the measures have failed to cripple the Russian economy, as Western politicians and experts had predicted. According to IMF figures, Russia&rsquo;s economy will grow faster this year than Germany&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Like Russia, Norway is a net exporter of fossil fuels, and is therefore better positioned to weather the energy crisis than most of its EU counterparts. Oslo hasn&rsquo;t been immune to blowback, however, and a $2.4 billion share of its sovereign wealth fund &ndash; a public pension fund made up of the surplus of its oil revenues &ndash; is currently <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/573940-norway-pension-fund-russian-assets-stuck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frozen</a> in a Russian bank due to Western sanctions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>London has dropped two charges against sanctioned businessman Mikhail Fridman</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Britain&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) has reportedly stopped investigating two out of the three allegations against Mikhail Fridman, just weeks after he revealed the letters of support he received from prominent Russian opposition activists, including Alexey Navalny&rsquo;s top aides.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The NCA has dropped the probe against Fridman for conspiracy to commit perjury and conspiracy to defraud the Home Office, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/132851c0-5a5c-4205-a621-518974a98838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a> reported on Tuesday. The 58-year-old banker is still being investigated for alleged money-laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>FT described the decision as a <em>&ldquo;setback&rdquo;</em> for the agency&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;anti-kleptocracy&rdquo;</em> cell, set up to pursue <em>&ldquo;Kremlin-linked individuals&rdquo;</em> and Russians trying to evade Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The Ukraine-born Fridman made his fortune in Russia, investing in banking, retail, oil and other fields before moving to London in 2015. He left Russia shortly after the conflict in Ukraine escalated in February 2022, insisting he had no ties to President Vladimir Putin. He was nonetheless included on the EU sanctions list, due to his stake in Alfa Bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fridman has <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/568419-lawsuits-eu-sanctions-court/">challenged</a> his inclusion on the blacklist before the European Court of Human Rights, along with several other Russian &lsquo;oligarchs&rsquo;. Under the sanctions, he is limited to an allowance of &pound;2,000 ($2,500) a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/568419-lawsuits-eu-sanctions-court/"></a>In early December 2022, more than 50 NCA officers raided his home in London&rsquo;s Highgate. Fridman was <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/567624-fridman-arrest-london-fine/">arrested</a> but released on bail shortly thereafter. He has continued to dispute the legality of the search warrant with the NCA, and reportedly described the sanctions and the investigation as part of a pressure campaign to force him back to Russia.</p>

]]><![CDATA[
    

<p>Fridman has also made a series of moves to encourage London and Brussels to drop the sanctions. He and his business partner, Pyotr Aven, leaked to the press earlier this month that they were <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/572750-russia-bank-sale-sanctions/">planning to divest</a> from their share in Alfa Bank.</p>
<p>On March 14, Fridman also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8f1cb299-dc7e-45f3-9fe2-6dad5b68573e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> the existence of multiple letters from various Russian opposition activists &ndash; including Nobel Prize winner Dmitry Muratov and two executives from Alexey Navalny&rsquo;s Anti-Corruption Foundation. Navalny&rsquo;s top aide, Leonid Volkov, resigned from the foundation due to backlash, calling the letter <em>&ldquo;a big political mistake.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The foundation&rsquo;s executive director, Vladimir Ashurkov, who also signed a document on Fridman&rsquo;s behalf last year, said the letters did not call for the removal of sanctions, but argued it would be useful for the purpose of <em>&ldquo;splitting elites&rdquo;</em> and getting the <em>&ldquo;relatively healthy&rdquo;</em> businessmen to denounce the Kremlin.</p>
<p><strong></strong>UK and European policymakers told FT, however, that inducing behavior change was <em>&ldquo;simply not the point&rdquo;</em> of the sanctions against Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Certain types of personnel will be able to serve until the age of 72, Sebastien Lecornu has announced</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>France is set to raise the maximum age for military reservists to 70, with<em> &ldquo;certain specialists&rdquo;</em> allowed to stay on until the age of 72, Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu has announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The official unveiled the impending hike during an interview with French broadcaster RTL on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;A lot of people of quality find themselves ejected because of this age limit, which makes no sense,&rdquo;</em> the minister explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will increase the age limits... People will be able to be a reservist in the French military until they are 70 years old and until they are 72 years old for certain specialists,&rdquo;</em> Lecornu stated.</p>
<p>The current maximum age is between 60 and 65 depending on a reservist's role. In addition to significantly increasing the age limit, France also seeks to double its reservist force from the current 40,000 to 80,000.</p>

<p>The overhaul of the reservist force, a pool of trained soldiers eligible for call-up if necessary, comes as France is set to gradually increase its military spending &ndash; from &euro;43.9 billion this year to &euro;69 billion by 2030. The spending hike on defense is needed for France to <em>&ldquo;remain in the club of nations able to defend themselves&rdquo;</em> and to tackle various<em> &ldquo;threats,&rdquo;</em> including those stemming from the ongoing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, Lecornu explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are several objectives with this unprecedented budget package: to continue to repair what has been damaged, a certain number of budget cuts have affected our army model&hellip;and we have a succession of threats that are all adding up,&rdquo;</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement of the age hike for reservists comes amid continuing unrest over a pension reform that increases the retirement age in France by two years, from 62 to 64. The measure itself, combined with President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s decision to push the reform through without a full legislative procedure, has proven unpopular, triggering strikes, mass protests, and widespread violence across the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Materials found during a search of Audrey Hale’s home indicated the attack was planned ‘over a period of months’</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Police found seven guns, a cache of ammunition, school memorabilia, and multiple journals, as well as a suicide note during their search of Nashville shooter Audrey Hale&rsquo;s home last Monday. Hale opened fire at The Covenant School on March 27, killing three children and three adults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shooter, who &ldquo;<em>acted totally alone</em>,&rdquo; planned the attack &ldquo;<em>over a period of months</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>considered the actions of other mass murderers</em>&rdquo; in formulating a strategy, police said in a press release on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the seven guns stashed in the family home without Hale&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; knowledge, which were disclosed to the public last week, investigators turned up multiple Covenant School yearbooks and a school photo. Hale, whom police have confirmed identified as transgender, was a student at Covenant over a decade ago. The journals found at the Hale family home and in Hale&rsquo;s vehicle in the school parking lot include extensive entries on &ldquo;<em>school shootings</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>firearm courses.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>While police initially claimed to have found a &ldquo;<em>manifesto</em>&rdquo; detailing the 28-year-old&rsquo;s plan of attack upon executing the search warrant last Monday and said Hale might have had some &ldquo;<em>resentment</em>&rdquo; about attending the Christian elementary school, no definitive motive has yet been made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A widely-shared quote purporting to be from Hale&rsquo;s manifesto &ndash; &ldquo;<em>You mess with our kids, we kill your kids</em>&rdquo; &ndash; could not be confirmed to Newsweek by the public affairs director for the Nashville Police Department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears to originate from a misunderstanding of a tweet by conservative commentator Jack Posobiec.</p>
<p>While many have called for the contents of Hale&rsquo;s manifesto (or suicide note) to be made public to gain an insight into the killer&rsquo;s state of mind, others have urged police to squash it, hinting there could be negative consequences to its publication. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department told the Daily Caller last Tuesday that it would &ldquo;<em>not be releasing the manifesto during an open investigation.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Armed with three guns said to have been purchased legally, Hale entered Covenant on March 27 by breaking through a glass door, firing 152 rounds over the course of the attack. The carnage lasted just 14 minutes before police arrived on the scene and fatally shot Hale. The victims, three nine-year-old students, a school custodian, a substitute teacher, and school head Katherine Koonce, were believed to be chosen randomly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>British regulators slapped the Chinese company with a $16 million penalty for collecting information from underage users</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The UK&rsquo;s privacy watchdog has fined TikTok &pound;12.7 million ($15.9 million) for failing to remove users under the age of 13 and for using their data without parental consent. The ruling comes as Western governments crack down on the wildly popular Chinese video app.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO) said that more than a million British children under the age of 13 used TikTok in 2020, in contravention of the app&rsquo;s terms of service. TikTok <em>&ldquo;did not do enough&rdquo;</em> to remove these underage users, the watchdog stated, adding that the company used their data without obtaining parental consent.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll,&rdquo;</em> UK Information Commissioner John Edwards said in a press release.</p>
<p><strong></strong>TIkTok insisted that it invests <em>&ldquo;heavily to keep under 13s off the platform,&rdquo;</em> stressing that its 40,000-strong safety team monitors accounts for signs of underage use.</p>

<p>The platform has been handed similar punishments before. The US Federal Trade Commission found in 2019 that the app &ndash; then called Musical.ly &ndash; violated US privacy law by allowing children under 13 to sign up without parental consent. The FTC and Musical.ly agreed on a settlement of $5.7 million.</p>
<p>In the EU, breaches of the bloc&rsquo;s privacy laws are usually investigated by Ireland, as most of the biggest multinational tech firms have their EU headquarters in Dublin. After opening a similar investigation into TikTok&rsquo;s handling of underage user data in 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s Data Protection Commission proposed an undisclosed <em>&ldquo;preliminary range of fines&rdquo;</em> on the company last November, Irish media <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/11/24/dpc-to-impose-preliminary-range-of-fines-on-tiktok-over-childrens-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from these investigations, TikTok has been accused by multiple Western governments of sharing user data with the Chinese government, a charge both it and Beijing deny. Nevertheless, TikTok has been banned from government-issued devices in the US, UK, and EU&rsquo;s main institutions, as well as in more than a dozen other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TikTok claimed that the bans were imposed <em>&ldquo;with no deliberation or evidence,&rdquo;</em> based on <em>&ldquo;basic misinformation.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The former US president has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts in the indictment against him</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump has entered not guilty pleas on all 34 criminal charges against him after surrendering for arrest in a New York City case stemming from his alleged 2016 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Trump, 76, was arraigned on Tuesday in a Manhattan courtroom, becoming the first president in US history to face criminal prosecution. His lawyers have denounced the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23741554/donald-j-trump-indictment.pdf">indictment</a> as a politically-driven <em>&ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo;</em> perpetrated by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who ran for office on a pledge to prosecute the former leader and whose campaign was funded largely by billionaire activist George Soros.</p>
<p>Trump reportedly sat with his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-faces-day-court-historic-us-first-2023-04-04/">hands folded</a>, flanked by his lawyers, as he said <em>&ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;</em> when asked how he pleaded to the charges. Prior to the court hearing, he waved to a crowd gathered outside the courthouse after being driven in a motorcade from his home at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He held his fist in the air as he left Trump Tower in front of reporters. He ignored questions as he left the courtroom.</p>

<p>A Manhattan grand jury voted last week to indict Trump on 34 charges of falsifying business records in connection with a $130,000 payment to Daniels. The payment was allegedly made by Trump&rsquo;s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, to buy Daniels&rsquo; silence about an affair with the billionaire, who was on his way to winning the 2016 presidential election at the time. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Heading to Lower Manhattan, the courthouse,&rdquo;</em> Trump said in a Truth Social post on his way to court on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;Wow, they are going to arrest me. Can&rsquo;t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Trump critics have argued that the indictment shows that no one is above the law in America. However, the case may be the beginning of a new chapter for the US political system, as it marks the arrest not only of a former president, but also the leading opposition-party candidate in the 2024 presidential election.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Microsoft founder has a stake in one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has broken with hundreds of AI researchers and tech leaders and opposed a worldwide pause on the development of powerful artificial intelligence. The software tycoon told Reuters that he believed the technology would bring <em>&ldquo;huge benefits.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think asking one particular group to pause solves the challenges,&rdquo; </em>Gates told Reuters on Tuesday, a week after more than 1,000 scientists, researchers, and tech leaders signed an open letter demanding a six-month moratorium on <em>&ldquo;giant AI experiments.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really understand who they&rsquo;re saying could stop, and would every country in the world agree to stop, and why to stop,&rdquo;</em> Gates continued. <em>&ldquo;Clearly there&rsquo;s huge benefits to these things &hellip; what we need to do is identify the tricky areas,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573821-musk-open-letter-ai-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter</a> &ndash; whose signatories included Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak &ndash; listed AI&rsquo;s potential to escape human control, render jobs obsolete, and &ldquo;replace&rdquo; human beings as potential outcomes to its continued development. Other AI critics have gone further, with Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) co-founder Eliezer Yudkowsky <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573972-ai-danger-nuclear-yudkowsky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a> last week that <em>&ldquo;literally everyone on earth will die&rdquo;</em> if AI evolves to the point where it <em>&ldquo;won&rsquo;t stay confined to computers.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The letter explicitly recommended that AI labs stop training their systems beyond the capabilities of OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4 language model, which &ndash; according to its creators &ndash; can already outperform 90% of humans on a simulated bar exam and score in the 93rd percentile on an SAT reading exam.</p>
<p>Musk was an early financier of OpenAI and has since turned skeptic, while Gates was later to provide his backing but has emerged as an AI evangelist. Microsoft partnered with OpenAI in 2019 and handed the firm $1 billion to build a human-level artificial intelligence on its Azure cloud computing platform, and the software giant announced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-announces-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-chatgpt-maker-openai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another investment</a> of up to $10 billion in OpenAI in January.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The age of AI has begun,&rdquo;</em> Gates wrote in a <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> last month, published a day before Musk&rsquo;s letter. AI <em>&ldquo;will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other,&rdquo;</em> he continued, claiming that the technology will help teach disadvantaged children, assist doctors working in poorer countries, and fight climate change, although he did not explain exactly how it would handle the latter task.</p>

            <p>Charlie Javice, the 31-year-old founder of student-aid assistance app Frank, lied about having 4 million clients&rsquo; data in order to dupe banking giant JP Morgan Chase into buying her company for $175 million, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a fraud complaint against Javice on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Javice and another executive at Frank &ldquo;<em>engaged in a months-long scheme to fabricate the data that both of them knew JPMC was paying $175 million to acquire</em>,&rdquo; the SEC stated. The app supposedly had information on more than 4 million college students who had used it to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Rather than help students, we allege that Ms. Javice engaged in an old school fraud</em>,&rdquo; SEC enforcement division director Gurbir Grewal said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Javice approached JP Morgan Chase in 2021, offering up a goldmine of potential customers and their data in the form of Frank, which the bank saw &ndash; according to a separate lawsuit against Javice filed last year &ndash; as &ldquo;<em>a proven acquisition machine for college aged students</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the deal, she got $9.7 million and a managing partner position at JP Morgan Chase, a cushy job that came with a $20 million retention bonus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, just 300,000 of Frank&rsquo;s customers actually existed, according to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint. The other 4.265 million were allegedly cooked up with the help of a local data science professor whom Javice had paid $18,000 for the job when JP Morgan Chase asked for proof that Frank&rsquo;s user base was as large as she claimed.</p>
<p>After convincing the bank the fake data was legitimate, Javice and her co-conspirator paid $105,000 to a third-party data compiler for its own data on in-college students and another $75,000 to another data compiler for email and phone number data to fill out that list in an effort to reinforce the fraud, according to the SEC complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alleged scam was nevertheless uncovered when JP Morgan Chase sent a marketing test email to its new audience &ndash; only to find that just 28% of the emails were delivered and just 1.1% of those were actually opened. A typical email marketing campaign for the company is able to deliver 99% of emails, with a read rate about 30%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Javice, who appeared in Forbes Magazine's "30 Under 30" list for finance in 2019, is no longer employed by JP Morgan Chase. She has denied the allegations and filed a countersuit in response to the bank&rsquo;s 2022 lawsuit against her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Groups representing US military veterans have sued to demand information on hazardous materials at K2 base in Uzbekistan</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Pentagon has hidden information on uranium, nerve gas and other hazardous materials that allegedly&nbsp;caused American troops to fall ill while stationed at an Uzbek military base in the early years of&nbsp;the war in Afghanistan, groups representing ex-soldiers have claimed in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The federal court lawsuit was filed on Monday in Connecticut, demanding that the Pentagon turn over its records on the toxins to which troops were exposed at the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base, known as <em>&ldquo;K2,&rdquo;</em> during US operations there from 2001 to 2005. At least 15,777 US service members were deployed at the base, from which US troop transports and air strikes on targets in Afghanistan were staged.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These K2 victims have been living with this truth inside their bodies for over 20 years, and many died as that toxic truth took them to their early graves,&rdquo;</em> Kim Brooks, a board member for the Stronghold Freedom Foundation, said on Monday at a press briefing in New Haven, Connecticut. <em>&ldquo;Yet we still do not know exactly what lurked in the air and water and the earth at K2. We do not know because the government refuses to release the records of the toxins found at K2.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenBlumenthal</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CTVeteransLegal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CTVeteransLegal</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/YaleVetsClinic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@YaleVetsClinic</a> on behalf of all K2 Veterans and surviving spouses, thank you for the support in filing our FOIA against the DOD today. <a href="https://t.co/vVlUMNaLi3">pic.twitter.com/vVlUMNaLi3</a></p>&mdash; Stronghold Freedom Foundation (@SFF_K2) <a href="https://twitter.com/SFF_K2/status/1643062836896071681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Brooks&rsquo; husband, US Army Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Brooks, died of a brain tumor at age 36 in 2004, less than three years after being stationed at K2. A preliminary study by the US Army found in 2015 that K2 veterans were five times more likely than other troops to develop cancer. The contaminants allegedly included pools of <em>&ldquo;black goo&rdquo;</em> that caused troops to pass out.</p>

<p>A US Department of Defense spokesman contacted by ABC News on Monday declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Pentagon has claimed that it&rsquo;s doing a more in-depth investigation because the 2015 study was too limited to show a definitive link between K2 and serious illnesses.</p>
<p>US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who joined the plaintiff groups at Monday&rsquo;s press conference, said the lawsuit shows the government&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;neglect and disregard of our veterans.&rdquo;</em> He added that the list of hazardous materials to which troops were exposed at K2 is <em>&ldquo;staggering, and the neglect is stunning.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The lawsuit marks just the latest controversy over exposure of US service members to carcinogens and other toxins. The Pentagon acknowledged last month that US military pilots and ground crew members have contracted various types of cancer at abnormally high rates. In February, the US Air Force expanded its investigation of cancer risks for troops stationed at the country&rsquo;s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) bases. Veterans have claimed high rates of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, among people who worked at the ICBM bases.</p>

                            <p><strong>Kiev will receive another $2.6 billion worth of weapons, ammunition and services</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Department of Defense on Tuesday <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3350958/biden-administration-announces-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a list</a> of ammunition, weapons systems and other <em>&ldquo;security assistance&rdquo;</em> intended for Ukraine, amounting to $500 million from the Pentagon&rsquo;s own stockpiles and another $2.1 billion commissioned from the US military industry.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The <em>&ldquo;presidential drawdown&rdquo;</em> portion mainly consists of undisclosed amounts of ammunition for various tank, artillery and mortar systems, as well as for HIMARS rocket launchers and Patriot air defense batteries. Instead of Javelin anti-tank rockets, the batch includes the older TOW systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Other items of note include 11 tactical recovery vehicles, 61 heavy fuel tankers, and 10 tractor-trailers for transporting heavy equipment such as tanks &ndash; all suggesting that Washington is helping Kiev prepare for the much-heralded <em>&ldquo;spring offensive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>By the Pentagon&rsquo;s own admission, this is the 35th such drawdown from US inventory since August 2021 &ndash; long before the Russian operation in Ukraine began. The second portion, amounting to four times as much in dollar value, will be provided from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds, designated to buy <em>&ldquo;capabilities&rdquo;</em> from US industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the equipment and ammunition that still needs to be produced are missiles for the NASAMS air defense systems, nine 30-mm anti-drone gun trucks, ten anti-drone rocket systems, and three air surveillance radars. The US also wants to send Kiev ammunition for 30mm and 23 mm autocannons, 122mm and 130mm artillery, 122mm &lsquo;Grad&rsquo; rockets, 81mm and 120mm mortars, 120mm tank guns, more Javelins, as well as 3,600 small arms and 23 million rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Kiev can hope to eventually get seven more tactical recovery vehicles, another eight heavy fuel tankers and 105 trailers for them, armored bridging vehicles capable of supporting Western tanks, and more satellite communications equipment, among other things.</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to a <em>&ldquo;fact sheet&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Apr/04/2003192566/-1/-1/1/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-APR-4.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> by the Pentagon, the US has committed $35.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office, including $700 million sent before the hostilities with Russia escalated in February 2022.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Though the US Congress has so far appropriated over $113 billion for aid to Ukraine, only about 20% of that has been direct cash aid to Kiev, the top congressional Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/573814-congress-ukraine-aid-deloitte/">revealed last week</a>. According to Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas, <em>&ldquo;approximately 60% is going to American troops, American workers, and on modernizing American stockpiles.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Moscow has repeatedly warned the US and its allies that continued military shipments to Kiev only prolong the conflict and risk direct confrontation. Washington and NATO have ignored the warnings, however, insisting that sending Ukraine everything from rifles to tanks and publicly stating that Russia <em>&ldquo;must lose&rdquo;</em> doesn&rsquo;t make them parties to the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A top Air Force officer has warned that parts shortfalls might threaten availability of the F-35 in a major conflict</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The <em>&lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo;</em> supply chain that provides the parts used to make America&rsquo;s F-35 fighter jets could jeopardize the ability of US forces to keep the aircraft in service during the country&rsquo;s next major war, the officer in charge of the program has reportedly claimed.</p>
<p>The F-35 program will need <em>&ldquo;a more resilient supply chain to ensure the military can keep it flying in a future, highly contested war,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/2023/04/03/just-in-time-f-35-supply-chain-too-risky-for-next-war-general-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defense News</a> reported on Monday, citing comments by US Air Force Lieutenant General Michael Schmidt. Speaking at the Navy League&rsquo;s Sea Air Space conference on Monday in Maryland, Schmidt warned that parts shortages could lead to disaster in a major conflict.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When you have that [just-in-time] mentality, a hiccup in the supply chain, whether it be a strike . . . or a quality issue, becomes your single point of failure,&rdquo;</em> the program chief said. <em>&ldquo;We need to look at, what does &lsquo;right&rsquo; look like in the future, to give us more resilience in a combat environment.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&lsquo;Just in time&rsquo;</em> refers to a distribution strategy used by businesses to maximize profitability by keeping inventory costs to a minimum. The idea is to have supplies ready and in place just when they&rsquo;re needed, rather than being set aside in a warehouse for future use. Such a system works well in the private sector, Schmidt said, but for a military fighting a war in <em>&ldquo;highly contested environments,&rdquo;</em> it can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Bridget Lauderdale, general manager of the F-35 program for defense contractor Lockheed Martin, said the company has focused more on forecasting demand for the jet so it can anticipate its parts needs more accurately. <em>&ldquo;A lot of those materials take lead time to prepare, even when you do have funding and even when you have repair capacity,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>
<p>Schmidt predicted that there will be between 500 and 600 F-35s operating in Europe within the next few years, and fewer than 100 will belong to the US military. <em>&ldquo;What a huge opportunity that is to leverage each other&rsquo;s logistics and maintenance environments.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Maintenance is a key concern for America&rsquo;s latest fighter jet, given the Pentagon&rsquo;s struggles to keep the aircraft in service. Schmidt acknowledged last week that on any given day in February, an average of just 29% of the US F-35 fleet was <em><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/03/engine-woes-dominate-f-35-hearing-but-other-issues-remain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;fully mission capable.&rdquo;</a></em>&nbsp;Just last month, the Pentagon&rsquo;s F-35 Joint Program Office ordered a global recall for the aircraft to fix an engine problem linked to at least one crash. US lawmakers have estimated that it will cost $1.3 trillion to sustain the nation&rsquo;s F-35 fleet, partly because of poor reliability.</p>]]></content:encoded>
