      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>This is the first of a series of consultant-written blogs around PCI DSS.</i></p>

<p>Many organizations have multiple IAM schemes that they forget about when it comes to a robust compliance framework such as PCI DSS.</p>

<p>There are, at minimum, two schemes that need to be reviewed, but consider if you have more from this potential, and probably incomplete, list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cloud service master account management AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Oracle Cloud Architecture (OCA),</li>
	<li>Name Service Registrars (E.g., GoDaddy, Network Solutions)</li>
	<li>DNS service (E.g., Akamai, CloudFront)</li>
	<li>Certificate providers (E.g., Entrust, DigiCert)</li>
	<li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service)) accounts (E.g.: Digital Realty, Equinix, Splunk, USM Anywhere (<a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/products/usm-anywhere#:~:text=USM%20Anywhere%20centralizes%20security%20monitoring,to%20detect%20threats%20virtually%20anywhere." target="_blank">USMA</a>), Rapid7)</li>
	<li>Servers and networking gear administrative account management (Firewalls, routers, VPN, WAF, load balancer, DDoS prevention, SIEM, database, Wi-Fi)</li>
	<li>Internal user account management, (Active Directory, LDAP or equivalent, and third parties who may act as staff augmentation or maintenance and repair services, API accesses)</li>
	<li>Consumer account management (often self-managed in a separate database using a different set of encryption, tools and privileges or capabilities, from staff logins).</li>
	<li>PCI DSS v4.0 expands the requirement to all system, automated access, credentialed testing, and API interfaces, so those need to be considered too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, in whatever fashion&nbsp;someone or something validates their authorization to use the device, service, or application, that authorization must be mapped to the role and privileges afforded to that actor. The goal being to ensure that each is provisioned with the least-privilege needed to be able to complete its or their intended function(s) and can be held accountable for their actions.</p>

<p>As many of the devices as possible should be integrated into a common schema, since having multiple devices with local only admin accounts is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>If privilege escalation is possible from within an already-authenticated account, the mechanism by which that occurs must be thoroughly documented and monitored (logged) too.</p>

<p>PCI DSS Requirement 7 asks the assessor to review the roles and access privileges and groupings that individuals could be assigned to, and that those individuals are specifically authorized to have those access rights and roles. This covers both physical and logical access.</p>

<p>Requirement 9 asks specifically about business-based need and authorization for visitors gaining physical access to any sensitive areas. Frequent visitors such as janitors and HVAC maintenance must be remembered when writing policy and procedures and when conferring access rights for physical access.</p>

<p>Requirement 8 then asks the assessor to put together the roles, privileges, and assignments with actual current staff members, and to validate that the privileges those staff currently have, were authorized, and match the authorized privileges. This is one of the few for-ever requirements of PCI DSS, so if paperwork conferring and authorizing access for any individuals or automation has been lost, it must be re-created to show authorization of the current access rights and privileges.</p>

<p>PCI DSS v4.0 requires much more scrutiny of APIs - which are a growing aspect of application programming. The design engineers need to ensure that APIs and automated processes are given, or acquire, their own specific, unique, authorization credentials, and the interface has session control characteristics that are well-planned, documented, and managed using the same schema created for Requirement 7. Cross-session data pollution and/or capture must be prevented. If the API is distributed as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, it cannot have default credentials programmed in, but the installation process must ask for, or create and store appropriately, strong credentials for management and use.</p>

<p>Requirements 1 and 6 both impact role and privilege assignments also, where separation of duties between development and production in both networking and code deployment is becoming blurred in today&rsquo;s <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/devsecops-build-and-test-process" target="_blank">DevSecOps</a> and agile world. However, PCI&rsquo;s standard remains strict and requires such separations, challenging very small operations. The intent is that no one person (or login ID) should have end-to-end control of anything, and no-one should be reviewing or QA&rsquo;ing and authorizing their own work. This might mean a small organization needs to contract one or more reviewers<sup>1</sup> if there&#39;s one person doing development, and the other doing deployment.</p>

<p>Even in larger organizations where developers sometimes need access to live production environments to diagnose specific failures, they must not be using the same login ID as they use for development. Organizations could choose <i>asmith</i> as the developer role and <i>andys</i> as the administrative login ID for the same person, to ensure privilege escalations are deliberately bounded and easily trackable (per requirement 10). Also, no-one should ever be using elevated privileges to perform their day-to-day job; elevations should always be used for point tasks and dropped as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>

<p>Next, third parties allowed into your cardholder data environment (CDE) - for maintenance purposes for instance - must always be specifically authorized to be there (physically or logically) and monitored while they are there. Most SIEM tools these days monitor everything indiscriminately, but PCI also says their access must be cut off as soon as it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>That might mean time-bounding their logical access, and it does mean escorting them while they are present. Staff must also be empowered and encouraged to challenge people with no badge, or no escort, and to escort them out of any sensitive area until their escort can be reunited with them. If your staff has access to customer premises where PCI-sensitive data is present, (either physically or logically) they must conduct themselves in like manner.</p>

<p>PCI DSS v4.0 also adds a requirement that any normally automated process that can be used interactively (e.g. for debugging) must log any of the interactive usage that occurs, with the appropriate individual&rsquo;s attribution.</p>

<p>Lastly, PCI DSS 4.0 adds credentialed testing using high access privileges for requirement 11 (although not necessarily administrative privilege), which requires those credentials to be designed into the overall requirement 7 schema and subjected to the requirement 8 restrictions and constraints.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Reviewers are secure-code reviewers and security-trained functional QA staff.</p>

      <title>How Can You Identify and Prevent Insider Threats?</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/how-can-you-identify-and-prevent-insider-threats</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/how-can-you-identify-and-prevent-insider-threats#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>If cyber threats feel like faceless intruders, you&rsquo;re only considering a fraction of the risk. Insider threats pose a challenge for organizations, often catching them by surprise as they focus on securing the perimeter.</p>

<p>There is a bright side, however. Understanding the threat landscape and developing a security plan will help you to mitigate risk and prevent cyber incidents. When designing your strategy, be sure to account for insider threats.</p>

<h2>What is an insider threat?</h2>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, insider threats are threats that come from within your organization. Rather than bad actors from the outside infiltrating your network or systems, these risks refer to those initiated by someone within your organization - purposefully or as a result of human error.</p>

<p>There are three classifications of insider threats:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Malicious</b> insider threats are those perpetrated purposefully by someone with access to your systems. This may include a disgruntled employee, a scorned former employee, or a third-party partner or contractor who has been granted permissions on your network.</li>
	<li><b>Negligent</b> insider threats are often a matter of human error. Employees who click on malware links in an email or download a compromised file are responsible for these threats.</li>
	<li><b>Unsuspecting</b> insider threats technically come from the outside. Yet, they rely on insiders&rsquo; naivety to succeed. For example, an employee whose login credentials are stolen or who leaves their computer unguarded may be a victim of this type of threat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keys to identifying insider threats</h2>

<p>Once you know what types of threats exist, you must know how to detect them to mitigate the risk or address compromises as quickly as possible. Here are four key ways to identify insider threats:</p>

<h3>Monitor</h3>

<p>Third parties are the risk outliers that, unfortunately, lead to data compromise all too often. Monitoring and controlling third-party access is crucial to identifying insider threats, as contractors and partners with access to your networks can quickly become doorways to your data.</p>

<p>Consider monitoring employee access as well. Security cameras and keystroke logging are methods some companies may choose to monitor movement and usage, though they may not suit every organization.</p>

<h3>Audit</h3>

<p>Pivotal to risk mitigation - for insider threats or those outside your network - is an ongoing auditing process. Regular audits will help understand typical behavior patterns and identify anomalies should they arise. Automated audits can run based on your parameters and schedule without much intervention from SecOps. Manual audits are also valuable for ad hoc reviews of multiple or disparate systems.</p>

<h3>Report</h3>

<p>A risk-aware culture is based on ongoing communication about threats, risks, and what to do should issues arise. It also means establishing a straightforward process for whistleblowing. SecOps, try as they might, cannot always be everywhere. Get the support of your employees by making it clear what to look out for and where to report any questionable activity they notice. Employees can also conduct self-audits with SecOps&rsquo; guidance to assess their risk level.</p>

<h2>Best practices for prevention</h2>

<p>Prevention of insider threats relies on a few key aspects. Here are some best practices to prevent threats:</p>

<h3>Use MFA</h3>

<p>The low-hanging fruit in security is establishing strong authentication methods and defining clear password practices. Enforce strong, unique passwords, and ensure users must change them regularly. Multifactor authentication (MFA) will protect your network and systems if a user ID or password is stolen or compromised.</p>

<h3>Screen candidates and new hires</h3>

<p>Granted, bad actors have to start <i>somewhere</i>, so screening and background checks do not eliminate every threat. Still, it&rsquo;s helpful to have processes in place to screen new hires, so you know to whom you&rsquo;re granting access to your systems. Depending on the nature of the relationship, this best practice may also apply to third-party partners, contractors, and vendors.</p>

<h3>Define roles and access</h3>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, yet it&rsquo;s often overlooked. Each user or user group in your organization should have clearly defined roles and access privileges relevant to their needs. For example, your valuable data is left on the table if entry-level employees have carte blanche across your network. Ensure roles and access levels are well-defined and upheld.</p>

<h3>Have a straightforward onboarding and offboarding process</h3>

<p>Most organizations have a clear and structured onboarding process for registering and bringing users online. Your onboarding process should include clear guidelines for network usage, an understanding of what will happen in the case of a data compromise (deliberate or accidental), where to report issues, and other security measures.</p>

<p>Just as important - if not more - as onboarding is the offboarding process. <a href="https://techhq.com/2022/02/inactive-user-accounts-pose-security-threats-for-organizations/" target="_blank">Languishing user accounts</a> pose a major security risk as they lay theoretically dormant and unmonitored, and no user in the organization will notice if their account is being used. Ensure swift decommissioning of user accounts when employees leave the organization.</p>

<h3>Secure infrastructure</h3>

<p>Apply strict access controls to all physical and digital access points across your organization. Use least privileged access to limit accessibility, as recommended above. Opt for stronger verification measures, including PKI cards or biometrics, particularly in more sensitive business areas. Secure desktops and install gateways to protect your environment from nodes to the perimeter.</p>

<h3>Establish governance procedures</h3>

<p>Security requires everyone&rsquo;s participation, yet organizations need buy-in from key leadership team members and nominated people or a team to hold the reigns. Establishing a governance team and well-defined procedures will ensure attention to security risks at all times and save valuable time should a breach occur.</p>

<h2>The tools of the trade</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>&ldquo;Organizations must be able to </i><a href="https://www.cyberhaven.com/insider-threats/top-software-products/" target="_blank"><i>address the risks</i></a><i> from malicious insiders who intentionally steal sensitive data for personal reasons as well as users who can accidentally expose information due to negligence or simple mistakes.&rdquo;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to do it all alone. With a data-aware insider threat protection solution, you can rest with the peace of mind that you - and your network - are safe.</p>

      <title>Chinese fraudsters: evading detection and monetizing stolen credit card information</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/chinese-fraudsters-evading-detection-and-monetizing-stolen-credit-card-information</link>

      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>Cyber attacks are common occurrences that often make headlines, but the leakage of personal information, particularly credit card data, can have severe consequences for individuals. It is essential to understand the techniques employed by cyber criminals to steal this sensitive information.</p>

<p>Credit card fraud in the United States has been on the rise, with total losses reaching approximately $12.16 billion in 2021, according to Insider Intelligence. Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud constituted 72% of these losses, with a substantial portion attributed to Chinese fraudsters.</p>

<p>This article discusses the tactics employed by Chinese cyber actors in committing CNP fraud and their value chain.</p>

<p>Chinese fraudsters primarily target the United States for two reasons: the large population makes phishing attacks more effective, and credit card limits in the country are higher compared to other nations. These factors make the US an attractive market for card fraudsters.</p>

<p>Common methods for acquiring card information include phishing, JavaScript injection through website tampering, and stealing data via Trojan horse infections. Phishing is the most prevalent method, and this analysis will focus on phishing tactics and the monetization value chain of stolen credit card information.</p>

<p><img alt="subscribers" src="blog-content/subscribers.png" /></p>

<p>Chinese fraudsters have developed extensive ecosystems for their operations. In a card fraud community targeting Japan and the US, over 96,000 users have joined. For 3,000 Chinese yuan in Bitcoin, individuals can enroll in a bootcamp to learn phishing techniques through recorded videos and access resources for creating phishing sites and profiting from stolen credit cards.</p>

<p>According to the community leader, more than 500 students enrolled in the first half of 2022 alone. This leader has made significant profits, receiving 56 BTC over the past three years.</p>

<h2>Chinese fraudster ecosystem: actor&rsquo;s value chain</h2>

<p>The value chain of Card Non-present fraud is shown as the following picture.</p>

<p><img alt="actor's value chain" src="blog-content/actor_value_chain.png" /></p>

<p>To carry out these activities, Chinese fraudsters establish a value chain for CNP fraud, starting with setting up a secure environment. They anonymize IDs, falsify IP addresses, change time zones and language settings, alter MAC addresses and device IDs, modify user agents, and clear cookies to evade detection by security researchers and bypass various security measures.</p>

<p><img alt="value chain 2" src="blog-content/value_chain_2.png" /></p>

<p>Fraudsters also use residential proxies, which are infected domestic devices, to access targeted websites indirectly and avoid tracking. These proxies can be purchased from online providers, with payments made via stolen credit cards or bitcoin. By selecting the desired IP address, users can access the target site with a fake IP address, making it difficult to trace their activities.</p>

<p>One residential proxy service popular among Chinese fraudsters is "911," which is built using software distributed under the guise of a free VPN service. Once installed, users are unknowingly transformed into valuable residential proxies for fraudsters without their consent. The service offers locations at city granularity to match the target user&#39;s geographic location.</p>

<p><img alt="911 fraud tool" src="blog-content/911_fraud.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, fraudsters can select ISP and device fingerprints, such as browser version, operating system, and screen size. This information is usually acquired through phishing, and fraudsters select the ones used by the victims to imitate each victim&#39;s user behavior.</p>

<p>Researchers at Sherbrooke University in Canada recently published an analysis of the "911" service and found that about 120,000 PCs are rented through the service, with the largest number located in the United States. More information about the research can be found at <a href="https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/" target="_blank">https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/</a>.</p>

<p>Although the "911" service was shut down in July 2022, many new residential proxy providers have emerged, which are now used by Chinese fraudsters.</p>

<p><img alt="alt 911" src="blog-content/alt_911_.png" /><img alt="alt 911 2" src="blog-content/alt_911_2.png" /></p>

<h2>In-depth analysis: evasion techniques in anti-fraud systems to elude detection</h2>

<p>To set up phishing sites, several elements must be in place, including an email database to disseminate phishing emails and a phishing kit to create the phishing site. These elements can be acquired online through various channels. There are two methods to create phishing sites: by tampering with an existing website or by using rented servers or virtual private servers (VPS). The former has the advantage of a high reputation but is often detected and removed quickly. The latter method involves using the server and templates included in the phishing kit to impersonate various companies and brands.</p>

<p>Phishing kit templates are also available on the dark web, covering card companies, payment services, and online banking. These phishing kits incorporate various measures to avoid detection, such as blocking bot access and preparing a blacklist to prevent access from security companies and researchers. Additionally, these phishing kits also attempt to obtain the actual IP addresses of individuals accessing them through proxies, check their geolocation information, and return errors for access from outside China and the US.</p>

<p>Chinese fraudsters use elaborate phishing infrastructures and kits to create phishing sites and deceive users who access them via emails. To avoid being blocked by spam filters or reputation-based blocks, they continuously improve their content and environment. They change their IP addresses while maintaining a clean state and use multiple domain names to spread their risk, ensuring that they can continue phishing even if one domain is blocked.</p>

<p>Moreover, these fraudsters use URL redirect tools to show high-reputation URLs and disguise their phishing URLs as normal ones. If a phishing URL is blocked by email filters, they can use a different URL to continue phishing.</p>

<p>In summary, Chinese fraudsters use sophisticated phishing kits to evade tracking and detection. These phishing kits include anti-fraud features to counteract security researchers and organizations. They continuously improve their content and environment to avoid being blocked by spam filters and reputation-based blocks. They use multiple domain names and change their IP addresses to spread their risk, and they use URL redirect tools to disguise their phishing URLs as normal ones.</p>

<h2>Cashing out through popular platforms: TikTok and NFT exploitation</h2>

<p>Chinese fraudsters have a value chain that extends from the setup and misuse of cards to the cashing out stage, where they obtain unjust gains.</p>

<p><img alt="monetization process" src="blog-content/monetization.png" /></p>

<p>There are various methods of cashing out. One method is to directly purchase cryptocurrency or gift cards through websites using stolen credit card information, which is popular for U.S. cards.</p>

<p>Another method is to purchase products on an eCommerce site using stolen credit card information and have a domestic collaborator receive the products. The domestic collaborator then sends the purchased goods to China and obtains money, which is commonly used in Japan and other Asian countries that are geographically close to China.</p>

<p>In the monetization stage, fraudsters prefer products that can be easily resold, such as home appliances, brand bags, mobile phones, and gift cards.</p>

<p><img alt="monetization approaches" src="blog-content/monetization_approaches.png" /></p>

<p>In the past three years, new methods using TikTok and NFTs have emerged. One method involves purchasing TikTok coins with stolen card information and donating them to malicious influencers. In some cases, the fraudster and the influencer may be the same person, or another person may receive a commission fee. Additionally, NFTs and eBooks are also suitable for money laundering.</p>

<p>It is challenging to distinguish whether the credit card abuser is a fraudster or simply someone who wants to donate to a favorite influencer when donations are made on TikTok.</p>

<p>As a preliminary step to cashing out, fraudsters confirm the credit card limit. They may use methods such as pretending to be the rightful owner (social engineering) and calling the card company&#39;s call center to confirm the limit, disabling the one-time password authentication required for card use, or using other social engineering tactics. However, due to the language barrier, Chinese fraudsters don&#39;t often use this method.</p>

<h2>Preventing fraud at the monetization stage: Enhancing security measures</h2>

<p><img alt="preventing monetization" src="blog-content/preventing_monetization.png" /></p>

<p>In the value chain of fraud, actors&#39; roles are divided into three categories: phishers, credit card misusers who misuse credit card information, and monetization dealers who monetize the stolen information. By dividing the roles, they can concentrate on their area of expertise, and even if they are investigated by the police, they can avoid legal sanctions by stating that they merely received something from their friends and are unaware of what is happening.</p>

<p>Dealing with CNP fraud is difficult when focusing on upstream. It is critical to prevent misuse at the monetization process. Nowadays, man-in-the-middle attack phishing techniques have become the mainstream, and one-time-password (OTP) authentication is insufficient to defend against these attacks anymore. More advanced authentication methods, such as FIDO or passkeys, and more sophisticated machine learning models, will be indispensable soon.</p>

      <title>10 Reasons why businesses need mobile device management (MDM)</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/10-reasons-why-businesses-need-mobile-device-management</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/10-reasons-why-businesses-need-mobile-device-management#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/mobile-device-management-explained" target="_blank">Mobile device management (MDM)</a> refers to a type of software that allows businesses to manage, configure and secure mobile devices used by their employees. Companies use MDM solutions to maintain a secure environment across all the mobile devices they own or have access to, as well as provide features such as remote wipe, password policies, application management and data protection. This helps them ensure security while providing their employees with access to the applications and data they need.</p>

<p>An increasing number of businesses are either accepting that they need MDM or realising that what they have in place is not sufficient. With that in mind, below are ten reasons why MDM is an integral part of doing business in the 21st century.</p>

<h2>1. Enhanced security</h2>

<p>MDM technology provides an extra layer of security for businesses, protecting them from breaches and data loss. MDM solutions enable secure authentication, access control and encryption for devices, applications and data, which in turn helps to keep sensitive corporate information safe. <a href="https://esims.com/your-sim-card-can-be-hacked-but-a-tech-revolution-is-changing-that-hello-esims/" target="_blank">ESIMs, or embedded SIM cards</a> can enhance the security of mobile devices even further by allowing businesses to remotely manage and secure their devices.</p>

<p><a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/10-ways-b2b-companies-can-improve-mobile-security" target="_blank">Improved security</a> is one of the most important reasons why businesses need MDM solutions. With an ever-increasing number of cyber threats, it is essential for companies to take steps to keep their data and systems secure. MDM can help with this.</p>

<h2>2. Increased productivity</h2>

<p>MDM makes it easier for employees to access the applications and data they need, increasing their productivity and efficiency. By providing them with secure access to the resources they need, MDM solutions help remove the frustration of not being able to do their job due to technical issues or security policies.</p>

<p>The ability to securely access corporate resources from anywhere, at any time, helps boost employee productivity and gives them the freedom they need to work more flexibly.</p>

<h2>3. Reduced costs</h2>

<p>MDM solutions can help reduce costs in several ways. They enable companies to better manage their mobile devices and applications, which ensures that they are up-to-date with the latest security patches and features. This helps reduce maintenance costs associated with managing outdated equipment.</p>

<p>MDM solutions also make it easier for businesses to deploy new applications, as they don&rsquo;t have to worry about manually configuring each device. This reduces expensive install times and makes it easier for employees to get started quickly.</p>

<h2>4. Improved compliance</h2>

<p>MDM solutions help businesses comply with industry standards and regulations. They enable companies to configure devices to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/feature/Why-a-mobile-security-policy-is-a-must-have-corporate-policy" target="_blank">meet specific security requirements</a>, as well as monitor and manage mobile devices so that they adhere to corporate policies.</p>

<p>By ensuring that all company devices are configured securely, MDM solutions reduce the risk of <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/5-steps-to-respond-to-a-data-breach" target="_blank">data breaches and fines</a> associated with non-compliance. What&#39;s more, they can help identify areas where businesses need to improve their compliance processes.</p>

<h2>5. Easier troubleshooting</h2>

<p>MDM solutions can make it easier for IT administrators to troubleshoot issues on mobile devices. As they give IT teams a centralized view of all connected devices, it&rsquo;s simple for them to identify any problems quickly and take appropriate action.</p>

<p>This ability to easily monitor employee mobile devices also makes it easier for IT teams to provide support and help employees get back to work faster. Not only does this help reduce the time IT teams need to spend troubleshooting, but it also improves employee satisfaction.</p>

<h2>6. Improved user experience</h2>

<p>MDM solutions can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/06/15/the-importance-of-improving-user-experience/" target="_blank">improve the user experience</a> by providing users with fast, secure access to the applications and data they need. This helps reduce frustration and makes it easier for employees to do their job, which in turn boosts productivity.</p>

<p>MDM solutions also make it easy for companies to deploy new apps and updates remotely, meaning that users always have access to the latest software versions. This ensures that all mobile devices are running optimally and delivers a better overall user experience.</p>

<h2>7. Device optimization</h2>

<p>MDM solutions enable businesses to optimize individual mobile devices for specific tasks. For example, corporate-owned devices can be configured with the exact set of features needed for each employee&rsquo;s role, improving their efficiency and reducing costs associated with managing unnecessary features.</p>

<p>Furthermore, MDM solutions can also be used to remotely configure devices for different network settings or regions. This allows businesses to easily manage a fleet of <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/establishing-a-mobile-device-vulnerability-management-program" target="_blank">mobile devices</a> in different locations, ensuring that each device is optimized for its specific use case.</p>

<h2>8. Improved customer service</h2>

<p>MDM solutions can help improve customer service by providing employees with secure access to the applications and data they need when interacting with customers. This helps ensure that customer queries are dealt with promptly and accurately, improving overall customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>The ability to remotely monitor mobile devices also makes it easier for IT teams to proactively identify any issues before they become major problems, further enhancing customer service.</p>

<h2>9. Increased visibility and control</h2>

<p>MDM solutions enable businesses to gain greater visibility over their mobile devices, allowing them to quickly identify which devices are connected, what applications they&rsquo;re running, and how they&rsquo;re being used.</p>

<p>This, in turn, gives IT teams greater control over their deployments, ensuring that all company-owned devices are used for appropriate purposes and helping to reduce the risk of data breaches.</p>

<h2>10. Reduced costs associated with lost or stolen devices</h2>

<p>By using MDM solutions, businesses can remotely lock down or wipe any device that is lost or stolen. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive business data, reducing the cost of potential data breaches or fines associated with non-compliance.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, MDM solutions can also help businesses save money by allowing them to manage and monitor their mobile devices remotely, reducing the need for costly onsite visits.

      <title>API security: the new security battleground</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/api-security-the-new-security-battleground</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/api-security-the-new-security-battleground#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>&ldquo;While defenders pursue the most powerful and advanced solutions they can find, the enemy needs only a single user with a bad password or an unpatched application to derail an entire defensive position.&rdquo;</i> This quote by Dr. Chase Cunningham from his book, &ldquo;Cyber Warfare &ndash; Truth, Tactics, and Strategies,&rdquo; seems a fitting way to begin the topic of cybersecurity battlegrounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the techniques used, going big, expensive, and glossy &ndash; while potentially useful - doesn&rsquo;t replace the need for a well-reasoned approach to securing assets founded on traditional activities and principles. Innumerable assets are housed behind APIs, and the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3527858/apis-are-becoming-a-major-target-for-credential-stuffing-attacks.html" target="_blank">widespread use of APIs</a> means they are high-profile targets. Securing them is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Two historical books came to mind for this topic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Art of War, by Sun Tzu</li>
	<li>Book of Five Rings, by Miyamoto Musashi</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose these two due to their applicability to the topic (oddly enough because they are less specific to modern security &ndash; something about their antiquity allows for a broader application).</p>

<p>After revisiting the books, I decided to take Musashi&rsquo;s five (5) principles (scrolls; Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void) and match them as best as possible with 5 of the numerous teachings from Sun Tzu. I then applied them to securing APIs in the growing cybersecurity arena where there are an increasing number of threat actors.</p>

<div>
<h2>Earth</h2>
</div>

<p>Musashi&rsquo;s focus in the Earth Scroll is seeing the bigger picture. Practitioners need to know the landscape or the 30,000 ft view. Sun Tzu said, "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Apply</h3>
</div>

<p>One needs to understand the nature of API attacks and attackers in securing APIs. One example of a common exploit category is Security Misconfiguration.</p>

<p>Some fundamental API security activities that can prevent attacks before they even get started including following an SDLC, implementing access control, deploying some form of edge protection, using continuous monitoring and alerting, and using appropriate architecture and design patterns.</p>

<p><a href="https://salt.security/api-security-trends" target="_blank">API attackers are ruthless and relentless</a>. Most criminals want an easy win and using good defense will fend off a high percentage of attacks.</p>

<p>Encryption is a must, both in transit and at rest. The enemy can be thwarted by not being able to use what was stolen.</p>

<div>
<h2>WATER</h2>
</div>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to be experienced and flexible &ndash; or fluid - on an individual level, and that includes one&rsquo;s role in the company. Sun Tzu said, &ldquo;Be flexible.&rdquo;</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Apply</h3>
</div>

<p>Gathering <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence" target="_blank">cyber threat intelligence</a> (CTI) makes it possible to adapt to changing threats in real time. Intelligence gathering, even using Contextual Machine Learning (CML), means that one doesn&rsquo;t depend on past information, hearsay, rumors, or peer information. Rely on as much clear, relevant, and current information as possible about threats and risks for one&rsquo;s own company.</p>

<p>In addition to CTI, focus on a well-designed and tested incident response plan.</p>

<p>Intelligence and responding to incidents go a long way toward making company security agile and adaptable.</p>

<div>
<h2>FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p>The Fire aspect is about the actual use of the weapons (tools) on the battlefield. Sun Tzu said, "The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources."</p>

<p>Now that the proper foundations have been built, it&rsquo;s time to use the API tools that have been implemented.</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Apply</h3>
</div>

<p>Manage and maintain the API resources and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the API system, Ensuring secure authentication and authorization methods for API access.</p>

<p>Also, set fire to vulnerabilities through regular security testing. This should include vulnerability scanning and pentesting, if not red/blue/purple teaming, or even something like <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/" target="_blank">Chaos Monkey</a> to test uptime (an oft-overlooked aspect of API security).</p>

<div>
<h2>Wind</h2>
</div>

<p>This is also interpreted as &ldquo;Style.&rdquo; Here, the goal is to study (not just passively observe) opponents. Sun Tzu said, &ldquo;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&rdquo;</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Apply</h3>
</div>

<p>For the modern day, we&rsquo;ll expand this to studying how other companies have dealt with cybercrime and cyberattacks. One will improve by studying others based on facets such as industry, regulations, and org size.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for a company to a) think it&#39;s alone or b) believe it does better than anyone. This can lead to isolation. Org leaders have every reason to set their org apart - distinction is a major component in having a chance at creating a profitable, if not lasting, business. But there aren&#39;t all that many ways to uniquely secure a business - phishing is phishing whether against an international enterprise or a local coffee shop; an API for a fintech org is much the same as an API for ice cream shop (the architectures available are only in a few flavors) &ndash; many people can use it and abuse it.</p>

<p>Intelligence sharing with other companies can be helpful in creating a secure community.</p>

<div>
<h2>Void</h2>
</div>

<p>The idea here &ndash; also called Emptiness, is understood as "no mind." This doesn&rsquo;t mean that no brain activity is involved, but points more to intuition, awareness, and acting on instinct. Action doesn&rsquo;t always require thinking things through, getting input from others, and planning something. Some things &ndash; whether by natural inclination or by training - are just second nature.</p>

<p>Sun Tzu said, &ldquo;Utilize your strengths.&rdquo;</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Apply</h3>
</div>

<p>Play to your strengths: individual, departmental, corporate. There&rsquo;s no one else like you or your company.</p>

<p>Leverage the strengths of your API resources to enhance security. Make sure you know your tools in and out. Often, they&rsquo;re expensive and very likely, they&rsquo;re not used to full capacity.</p>

<p>Focus on continuous learning and improvement. This requires a team of individuals who work well together and are independently passionate about defending data.</p>

<p>This intuitiveness is not based on industry, spreadsheets, or data analysis but depends on relevant stakeholders&#39; individual and collective expertise. Often, it will be addressing many fronts at once, such as improved IR, developer training, choosing a platform that provides numerous API protections (while also avoiding a single point of failure), getting legal and compliance teams to determine next steps in the privacy regulation landscape, and performing regular incident response and disaster recovery exercises.</p>

<div>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
</div>

<p>To paraphrase the classic ending of many of Musashi&rsquo;s teachings, these ideas should be given careful and thorough reflection.</p>

      <title>Dridex malware, the banking trojan</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/dridex-malware-the-banking-trojan</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/dridex-malware-the-banking-trojan#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>Dridex, also known as Cridex or Bugat, is a banking Trojan that has been active since 2011. The malware is primarily used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial information, from victims. Dridex is known for its ability to evade detection by using dynamic configuration files and hiding its servers behind proxy layers.</p>

<p>The Dridex malware typically spreads through spam email campaigns, with the emails containing a malicious attachment or link that, when clicked, will install the malware on the victim&#39;s computer. The malware then uses web injections to steal financial information from the victim.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features of Dridex is its use of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network for command and control (C&amp;C) communication. This allows the attackers to evade detection by security researchers and law enforcement, as the C&amp;C servers can be quickly changed if one is discovered.</p>

<p>In terms of atomic techniques, Dridex uses a variety of methods to evade detection and maintain persistence on an infected system. Some of these techniques include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fileless infection: Dridex can infect a system without leaving any trace of a malicious file on the hard drive.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Process hollowing: Dridex can inject its code into a legitimate process in order to evade detection by security software.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Anti-debugging and anti-virtualization: Dridex can detect if it is running in a virtualized environment or if it is being debugged, and will terminate itself if it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dridex is a well-known and sophisticated banking trojan that has been active for more than a decade, the malware has been known to target financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Despite the arrest of one of its administrators in 2015, the malware continues to be active and evolve.</p>

<h2>Recent infection on Macs:</h2>

<p>The recent variant of Dridex malware that targets MacOS systems delivers malicious macros via documents in a new way. The malware typically spreads through spam email campaigns, with the emails containing a malicious attachment or link that, when clicked, will install the malware on the victim&#39;s computer. The variant overwrites document files to carry Dridex&#39;s malicious macros, but currently, the payload it delivers is a Microsoft exe file, which won&#39;t run on a MacOS environment. This suggests that the variant may still be in the testing stages and not yet fully converted to work on MacOS machines. However, it&#39;s possible that the attackers will make further modifications to make it compatible with MacOS in the future.</p>

<p>Once the malware is installed on the system, it searches for files with .doc extensions and overwrites them with the malicious code. The overwritten code has a D0CF file format signature, implying it is a Microsoft document file. This means that the malicious macros are delivered via document files, which makes it harder for the user to determine if the file is malicious or not.</p>

<p>The malware also uses basic string encryption to hide the malicious URL it connects to in order to retrieve a file. This method of delivery is different from the traditional method of delivery, which is through email attachments. This shows that the attackers behind Dridex are trying to find new targets and more efficient methods of entry.</p>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<p>Dridex is a banking Trojan that is typically distributed through phishing email campaigns. The malware is delivered as an attachment, often in the form of a Word or Excel document, that contains a malicious macro. Once the macro is enabled, it will download and execute the Dridex payload on the victim&#39;s system.</p>

<p>Once installed, Dridex can perform a variety of malicious actions, including keylogging, capturing screenshots, and stealing login credentials. The malware can also be used to create a botnet, allowing the attackers to remotely control the infected systems.</p>

<p>Dridex uses web injects, which are modules that can inject HTML or JavaScript code into a web page before it is rendered. This allows the malware to manipulate the appearance of web pages and trick the user into entering sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers. The malware can then send this information to its command and control (C2) server.</p>

<p>Dridex uses a variety of techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence on an infected system. These include using code injection to infect other processes, using named pipes to communicate with other processes, and using anti-debugging and anti-virtualization techniques to evade analysis.</p>

<p>In addition, Dridex uses a technique called "Heaven&#39;s Gate" to bypass Windows&#39; WoW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) layer, allowing it to execute 64-bit code on a 32-bit system. This technique involves using a feature in Windows that allows 32-bit applications to call 64-bit functions. By running malware code in a 64-bit environment, Dridex evades detection and anti-analysis by security tools that are not designed to detect 64-bit malware on 32-bit systems.</p>

<h2>Remediation:</h2>

<p>1. Isolate and remove the malware: Identify and isolate any infected systems and remove the malware using reputable anti-virus software.</p>

<p>2. Change all passwords: Dridex malware is known to steal login credentials, so it is important to change all passwords on the affected systems.</p>

<p>3. Patch the system: Ensure that all systems are fully patched and updated with the latest security fixes.</p>

<p>4. Use endpoint protection: Implement endpoint protection software to detect and block Dridex malware and other malicious software.</p>

<p>5. Monitor network traffic: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and block malicious traffic.</p>

<p>6. Employee education: Educate employees on how to identify and avoid phishing scams, and to be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links.</p>

<p>7. Regular backups: Regularly backup important data and keep backups in a secure location.</p>

<p>8. Use a firewall: Use a firewall to block incoming and outgoing connections from known malicious IP addresses.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>In conclusion, Dridex is a well-known banking trojan that has been active since 2012, targeting financial institutions and their customers. The malware is typically distributed through phishing email campaigns, using attachments or links that lead to the downloading of the malware. Once on a system, Dridex can use various techniques to steal sensitive information and uses a technique called web injection to manipulate web pages and steal credentials. Remediation efforts should include monitoring for suspicious activity, blocking known malicious IPs and domains, keeping software updated, and educating users on how to identify and avoid phishing attempts. Additionally, monitoring for known indicators of compromise and inspecting processes and dll files that are known to be targeted by Dridex can help detect and prevent Dridex infections.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s digital world, it&rsquo;s no surprise that cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and intense. Enterprises worldwide are trying to defend themselves against attacks such as ransomware, phishing, distributed denial of service and more.</p>

<p>In this challenging cybersecurity landscape, now is the time for companies to prioritize security audits. What are cybersecurity audits and how often should they be to remain safe in the threatening IT world?</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity audits and their importance</h2>

<p>A cybersecurity audit <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/security-audit" target="_blank">establishes a set of criteria</a> organizations can use to check the preventive cybersecurity measures they have in place to ensure they&rsquo;re defending themselves against ongoing threats.</p>

<p>Because cybersecurity risks and threats are growing more sophisticated and frequent in nature, organizations must plan and conduct cybersecurity audits regularly. In doing so, they will have continuous protection from external and internal threats.</p>

<h2>How often companies should perform security audits</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s no official schedule companies must follow for their cybersecurity audits, but in general, it&rsquo;s recommended that they perform audits at least once a year. However, the IT landscape is changing so quickly that more audits <a href="https://rehack.com/featured/how-to-secure-network-infrastructure-system/" target="_blank">often amount to better protection</a> for an organization.</p>

<p>Businesses working with sensitive information &mdash; such as personally identifiable information &mdash; should consider conducting cybersecurity audits twice a year, if not more frequently. However, keep in mind that your company may need more time or resources to perform quarterly or monthly audits. The goal is to balance the number of audits you perform and the amount you spend on the audits themselves.</p>

<p>There are many types of audits out there. For example, a blended audit that combines <a href="https://www.nqa.com/en-us/resources/blog/december-2022/benefits-of-blended-audits" target="_blank">remote and in-person auditing tasks</a> can be helpful for global organizations with remote workers. But two types of audits &mdash; routine and event-based &mdash; are important to know.</p>

<p>You should certainly conduct routine audits annually or semi-annually, and event-based audits should be done when any major events happen within your IT infrastructure. For example, suppose you add servers to your network or transition to a new project management software. In that case, these &ldquo;events&rdquo; require you to perform another audit, as the changes could impact your cybersecurity posture.</p>

<h2>4 Benefits of performing audits</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of a security audit is to find weaknesses in your cybersecurity program so you can fix them before cybercriminals exploit them. It can also help companies maintain compliance with changing regulatory requirements. Here are some of the primary benefits you can reap by performing regular security audits.</p>

<h3>1. Limits downtime</h3>

<p>Extended downtime can cost your business a lot of money. According to Information Technology Intelligence Consulting, <a href="https://itic-corp.com/forty-percent-of-enterprises-say-hourly-downtime-costs-top-1million/?ref=geektime" target="_blank">40% of organizations surveyed</a> say hourly downtime can cost them between one and five million dollars, excluding legal fees, penalties or fines.</p>

<p>Downtime can occur due to poor IT management or something more serious like a cybersecurity incident. Auditing is the first step companies must take to identify weaknesses that could eventually lead to downtime.</p>

<h3>2. Reduces the chance of a cyberattack</h3>

<p>As stated above, the main goal of a security audit is to identify vulnerabilities in your cybersecurity program. However, this is only helpful if you and your IT team develop solutions to patch these vulnerabilities and weaknesses. In doing so, you&rsquo;re improving your overall cybersecurity posture and increasing your level of protection against potential cyber risks, such as malware or phishing attacks, ransomware, and business email compromise &mdash; to name a few.</p>

<h3>3. Helps maintain client trust</h3>

<p>Customers and clients want to know the companies they do business with prioritize physical and cybersecurity. This gives them peace of mind that their sensitive data is not at risk of being exposed, stolen or even sold on the dark web.</p>

<p>Maintaining client trust <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/customer-trust" target="_blank">should be an important objective</a> for any company offering products or services. It can help build your customer base, enhance customer loyalty, and even improve brand recognition.</p>

<h3>4. Supports compliance efforts</h3>

<p>Security audits are beneficial for businesses looking to take their compliance efforts up a notch. Various data privacy and protection laws are emerging to try and protect consumers and their sensitive information.</p>

<p>For example, the EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">can impact your company</a>, especially if it has customers or does business with other organizations in the EU. It can be challenging to keep up with changing regulatory requirements. However, conducting a security audit can help IT teams ensure they&rsquo;re helping their companies comply with all these rules to avoid fees or penalties.</p>

<h2>Protect your business with regular security audits</h2>

<p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, with more threats emerging and attacks becoming more sophisticated than ever before. It&rsquo;s come to the point where hackers leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to launch automated attacks on enterprises. It&rsquo;s critical for your business to perform regular security audits to ensure you&rsquo;re protecting your assets and data. Consider performing audits on a semi-annual basis to offer the best defense against ongoing cybersecurity threats.</p>

      <title>BlackGuard stealer extends its capabilities in new variant</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/blackguard-stealer-extends-its-capabilities-in-new-variant</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/blackguard-stealer-extends-its-capabilities-in-new-variant#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p>AT&amp;T Alien Labs researchers have discovered a new variant of BlackGuard stealer in the wild, infecting using spear phishing attacks. The malware evolved since its previous variant and now arrives with new capabilities.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>BlackGuard steals user sensitive information from a wide range of applications and browsers.</li>
	<li>The malware can hijack crypto wallets copied to clipboard.</li>
	<li>The new variant is trying to propagate through removable media and shared devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>BlackGuard stealer is malware as a service sold in underground forums and Telegram since <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/analysis-blackguard-new-info-stealer-malware-being-sold-russian-hacking" target="_blank">2021</a>, when a Russian user posted information about a new malware called BlackGuard. It was offered for $700 lifetime or $200 monthly, claiming it can collect information from a wide range of applications and browsers.</p>

<p>In November 2022, an update for BlackGuard was announced in Telegram by its developer. Along with the new features, the malware author suggests free help with installing the command &amp; control panel (Figure 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="announcement in Telegraph" src="blog-content/announcement_in_telegraph.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 1. Announcement of new malware version in its Telegram channel.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>When executed, BlackGuard first checks if another instance is running by creating a Mutex.</p>

<p>Then to ensure it will survive a system reboot, the malware adds itself to the &ldquo;Run&rdquo; registry key. The malware also checks if it&#39;s running in debugger mode by checking TickCount and checking if the current user belongs to a specific list to determine whether it is running in a malware sandbox environment. (Figure 2)</p>

<p><img alt="Blackguard avoiding detection" src="blog-content/blackguard_avoiding_detection.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 2. Malware will avoid execution if running under specific user names.</p>

<p>Now all is ready for stealing the user&rsquo;s sensitive data. It collects all stolen information in a folder where each piece of data is stored in a specific folder, such as Browsers, Files, Telegram, etc. (Figure 3)</p>

<p><img alt="Blackguard main folder" src="blog-content/blackguard_main_folder.png" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 3. BlackGuard main folder with stolen data divided into folders.</p>

<p>When it finishes collecting sensitive data, the malware will zip the main folder using the password &ldquo;xNET3301LIVE&rdquo; and send it to its command &amp; control. (Figure 4)</p>

<p><img alt="Zipped exfiltration data" src="blog-content/zipped_exfil_data.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 4. Zipping exfiltrated data with password and uploading to command &amp; control.</p>

<p><b>Browser stealth</b></p>

<p>Along with collecting cookies, history and downloads of different browsers, BlackGuard also looks for the existence of special files and folders of different browsers. (This includes &ldquo;Login Data&rdquo;, AutoFill, History&nbsp;and Downloads. (Figure 5)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img alt="Blackguard collecting browser information" src="blog-content/blackguard_collecting_browser_info.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 5. Collecting browser information.</p>

<p>Below is the list of browsers BlackGuard is looking for:</p>

<p>It will also query the registry for the installation path of &ldquo;Dash&rdquo; and &ldquo;Litecoin&rdquo; keys and do the same.</p>

<p><b>Messaging and gaming applications:</b></p>

<p>BlackGuard supports the stealing of a wide range of messaging applications. For some of the applications such as Telegram, Discord and Pidgin, the malware has a specific handler for each. For example, for Discord, it copies all data for the following folders in the Application Data folder which stored the Discord tokens: &ldquo;Discord\Local Storage\leveldb&rdquo;, &ldquo;Discord PTB\Local Storage\leveldb&rdquo;, &ldquo;Discord Canary\leveldb&rdquo;. In addition, it copies all strings in files with the extension of &ldquo;.txt&rdquo; and &ldquo;.ldb&rdquo; if they match Discord&rsquo;s token regular expression. (Figure 6)</p>

<p><b>Outlook, FTP, VPN, and other applications</b></p>

<p>BlackGuard steals login data and other sensitive information from additional communication programs. For email applications, the malware queries specific Outlook registry keys under the CURRENT_USER hive to extract user, password and server information. (Figure 7)</p>

<p><img alt="exfil of Outlook data" src="blog-content/exfil_of_Outlook_data.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 7. Exfiltration of Outlook stored information.</p>

<p>The malware also handles different FTP and VPN applications to extract stored users and passwords. For example, for NordVPN, the malware will search the application&rsquo;s folder and if found, it parses all user.config files to extract the users and passwords. (Figure 8)</p>

<p><img alt="exfil NordVPN data" src="blog-content/exfil_NordVPN.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 8. Exfiltrating NordVPN information.</p>

<p>In addition to Outlook and NordVPN, BlackGuard also steals information from WinSCP, FileZilla, OpenVPN, ProtonVPN and Total Commander.</p>

<p><b>Other data collected&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>

<p>Additionally, the malware also collects information from the machine such as anti-virus software installed on the machine, external IP address, localization, file system information, OS and more.</p>

<h2>New BlackGuard features</h2>

<p><b>Crypto wallet hijacking</b></p>

<p>In addition to stealing crypto wallets saved/installed on the infected machine, BlackGuard is hijacking cryptocurrency addresses copied to clipboard (such as CTRL+C) and replacing them with the threat actor&rsquo;s address. This can cause a victim to send crypto assets to the attacker without noticing it when trying to transfer/pay to other wallets. This is done by tracking any content copied to the clipboard and matching it to relative different crypto wallets&rsquo; regex. (Figure 9)</p>

<p><img alt="regex to search" src="blog-content/regex_to_search.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 9. Specific regex to search in clipboard for listed coins.</p>

<p>Once there is a match, the malware will query its command and control for the alternative wallet and replace it in the clipboard instead of the one that was copied by the user. The malware supports stealing the popular crypto assets below:</p>

<p><b>Propagate through shared / removable devices</b></p>

<p>Although this feature was limited since Windows 7 to be used only for CDROM, the malware copies itself to each available drive with an &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorun.inf">autorun.inf</a>&rdquo; file that points to the malware to execute it automatically. This includes removable and shared devices. For example, if a USB device is connected to an old version of Windows, the malware will be executed automatically and infect the machine. (Figure 10)</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 10. Propagate to all available drives.</p>

<p><b>Download and execute additional malware with process injection</b></p>

<p>The new variant of BlackGuard downloads and executes additional malware from its command &amp; control. The newly downloaded malware is injected and executed using the &ldquo;<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/">Process Hollowing</a>&rdquo; method. With that the malware will be running under legitimate/whitelisted processes and can make more detection more difficult. (Figure 11)</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 11. Download and execute additional malware&nbsp;using process injection.</p>

<p>The targeted process is RuntimeDirectory folder, RegASM.exe (C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\runtime_version\RegAsm.exe)</p>

<p><b>Massive malware duplication</b></p>

<p>The malware copies itself to every folder in C:\ drive recursively, each folder the malware generates a random name to be copied to. This feature is not common for malware, and this is mostly annoying, as the malware gains no advantage from that.</p>

<p><b>Persistence</b><br />
The malware added persistence to survive system reboot by adding itself under the &ldquo;Run&rdquo; registry key. (Figure 12)</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 12. Setting registry persistence.</p>

<p><b>Documents - stealth activity</b></p>

<p>The malware searches and sends to its command and control all documents end with extensions &ldquo;.txt&rdquo;, &ldquo;.config&rdquo;, &ldquo;.docx&rdquo;, &ldquo;.doc&rdquo;, &ldquo;.rdp&rdquo; in the user folders (including sub directories): &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo;, UserProfile folder.</p>

      <title>How CIAM safely orchestrates your customers’ journey and its benefits </title>

      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>Customers&rsquo; willingness to give you their personal data begins with the experience they receive. Convincing them requires the right tone, an outlook of what they&rsquo;ll get in return, and most importantly, a high level of trust. But while companies depend on customer data to unlock growth, user-centric <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/what-is-data-as-a-service-daas-understanding-the-benefits-and-common-use-cases" target="_blank">data collection</a> can be tricky.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf" target="_blank">43% of U.S. consumers</a> say they would not allow companies to collect personal data, even to accommodate more personalized, customized experiences, while 88% will give you their data if they trust your brand.</p>

<p>With this in mind, how do you meet customer expectations and proactively build consumer trust throughout the entire customer lifecycle? Effective user journey orchestration, supported by a robust Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) solution, can help you balance security, privacy, and convenience, resulting in a trust-worthy digital experience.</p>

<h2>5 ways CIAM safely orchestrates your customers&rsquo; journey</h2>

<p>CIAM is an effective solution for hassle-free and secure logins that enables you to retain more customers with seamless access across various digital channels. This is how CIAM safely orchestrates your customers&rsquo; journey.</p>

<p>1. Capture and manage customer identities to remove friction at registration and login</p>

<p>Businesses spend a lot to acquire new customers but tend to invest less in the experience once acquired. Meanwhile, providing a seamless and convenient experience is what eventually brings loyalty &ndash; and thus, the base to harness true ROI.</p>

<p>With CIAM, you no longer need to push every customer through the same rigid authentication processes when they visit your site. Put simply, CIAM ensures customers are always met at the digital front door, conveniently and without friction. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if customers are registering for the first time, you don&#39;t need to ask them to enter all their personal data immediately. Ask your customer for only needed information, at the right point in their journey. This will allow them to focus on their <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/online-payment-security-8-steps-to-ensure-safe-transactions" target="_blank">shopping experience</a> or the task at hand rather than filling in forms.</p>

<p>When an existing customer wants to log into your site, you can make smarter decisions about how many authentication hoops you should make them jump through. For example, suppose the risk environment remains unchanged, and their behavioral context is the same as before. You might decide they don&#39;t need to enter their password again or <a href="https://www.welcometobora.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-safe-secure-login-and-access/" target="_blank">authenticate using MFA</a>.</p>

<p>CIAM allows you to adjust your authentication experience&#39;s friction level to make your customers&#39; experience seamless.</p>

<p>2. Build robust customer profiles based on first-party, consent-based data</p>

<p>CIAM captures the personal data that the customer has released to your brand. This first-party data, which is based on consumer consent, enables your business to compile comprehensive client profiles by collecting and combining data from multiple channels. The data produced can assist your company in achieving a unified customer experience as your consumer engages with various business divisions.</p>

<p>First-party data is essential as third-party cookies are being blocked from browsers, and businesses need to invest in <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/centralized-privacy-center-the-key-to-meeting-data-privacy-obligations" target="_blank">privacy-friendly ways to gather data</a> for profiling their prospective customers. Besides from harnessing the value of data, consent-based data collection is a demonstration of respecting your customer&rsquo;s privacy &ndash; a building block to achieving customers&rsquo; trust.</p>

<p>3. Orchestrate customer profiles in near real-time to other engagement solutions to deliver personalized experiences</p>

<p>Storing your customers&#39; profile data in a single platform allows you to make timely and data-informed decisions furthering engagement with your customer with other solutions.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the way Spotify works. When you search for your favorite artist, the platform suggests other artists with the same style. These suggestions allow you to listen to more of your favorite music and offer an impeccable personalized experience. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like your brand to treat your customers the same way?</p>

<p>If you get to know your customers better by building rich user profiles, you can use these profiles to tailor experiences across every digital property. And your customer will keep coming back to you for more.</p>

<p>4. Drive the adaptive authentication experience to limit burden and enhance security</p>

<p>Requiring your customers to provide an additional authentication factor by implementing MFA is one of the simplest ways to increase the security of the login flow. Email is an option that is often easier to implement, but it can increase customers&rsquo; effort at the authentication flow, and building frustration might cause them to opt for a competitor.</p>

<p>With CIAM, you can choose the authentication options, i.e., biometrics, that will be easiest or most secure for your customers without any additional worry about how difficult they might be to integrate and maintain within your application.</p>

<p>A customer identity platform only asks for the authentication you need and always asks for it when you need it, providing two sides of the same coin. If you can prove to customers that the friction added to the experience is always proportionate to the situation, you&#39;ll find it much easier to win their trust.</p>

<p>5. Adopt progressive profiling</p>

<p>A customer&#39;s introduction to your application is often a registration process, and you need to ensure that the process is efficient, seamless, and secure so that you don&#39;t lose the customer&#39;s attention along the way. This might mean primarily collecting only the minimum amount of information you require from your users. A &#39;just in time&#39; and &#39;just enough&#39; approach to data collection is the best strategy for building a frictionless and secure prospect-to-customer journey that leads to better conversion rates.</p>

<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/thales-and-onewelcome" target="_blank">A CIAM solution</a> can be configured to require as many or as few pieces of information about your customers as you wish to gather. This information can be stored centrally so that you can utilize the CIAM solution as the source of truth regarding customer personal information and be assured that this data is always secured.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The main advantage of effective user journey orchestration</h2>

<p>A significant benefit of deploying a cloud identity platform, and thereby adopting a user journey orchestration process, is that it helps establish the trust needed to build long-lasting relationships with your customers.</p>

<p>Businesses can acquire more customers by using CIAM and progressive profiling to streamline the registration process and asking for information over time rather than forcing new customers to fill out a long sign-up form at the very beginning. Also, reducing friction during login when existing customers return to any digital property can help your business retain customers.</p>

<p>By enforcing appropriate security measures in every situation, CIAM shows your customers that you are a trustworthy steward of their accounts and personal data. This increases the likelihood of repeat business, reduces the risk of account abandonment, and acts as a disincentive for churn.</p>

      <title>FTC extends deadline by six months for compliance with some changes to financial data security rules</title>
      <link>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/ftc-extends-deadline-by-six-months-for-compliance-with-some-changes-to-financial-data-security-rules</link>
      <guid>https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/ftc-extends-deadline-by-six-months-for-compliance-with-some-changes-to-financial-data-security-rules#When:10:00:00Z</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><i>The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author.&nbsp; AT&amp;T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>In a highly connected, internet-powered world, transactions take place online, in person, and even somewhere in between. Given the frequency of digital information exchange on our devices, including smartphones and smart home gadgets, <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/how-does-robust-cybersecurity-add-value-to-a-business" target="_blank">cybersecurity has never been more important</a> for protecting sensitive customer information. In response, the US Federal Trade Commission has rolled out updated measures to ensure that customers&rsquo; details are fully protected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to supply chain issues and qualified employee shortages, however, the FTC has granted a six-month extension on the original deadline, so businesses and financial institutions now have more time to complete the required changes. This article will look at the updated federal data security measures and how they will impact businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Updated federal data security measures</h2>

<p>In November, the United States Federal Trade Commission announced that it would <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/11/ftc-extends-deadline-six-months-compliance-some-changes-financial-data-security-rule" target="_blank">grant a six-month extension</a> for companies that have yet to update their security measures in compliance with updated FTC standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new deadline for businesses and financial institutions to implement the required changes will be June 9, 2023. By that point, all businesses must have updated their policies and procedures in keeping with the Financial Data Security Rule, also known as the Safeguards Rule.</p>

<h2>Initial changes to the Safeguards Rule</h2>

<p>Initially, the Federal Trade Commission approved changes to the Safeguards Rule in October 2021. These changes included updated criteria for financial institutions, providing more specific requirements about which safeguards they must include in their information security programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of these updates to the Safeguards Rule were implemented 30 days after the rule was published in the Federal Register, while other specific criteria were on track to be implemented on December 9, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why has the deadline been extended?</h2>

<p>The deadline has been extended to June 2023 due to reports presenting compelling arguments for postponing the required implementation. The Small Business Administration&rsquo;s Office of Advocacy, for example, <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/10164031/Safeguards-Extension-of-Implementation-Date-for-Filing.pdf" target="_blank">filed a letter</a> addressed to the FTC. The letter stated that several factors would bar companies from effectively implementing these updated security requirements in the allotted time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Between supply chain issues that could cause delays in transporting essential equipment for the requisite security system upgrades, and a widespread shortage of qualified information security experts who could implement the changes on time, the letter from the SBA convincingly spelled out why businesses would need more time to complete the security system upgrades in compliance with FTC rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these issues, making it difficult for small-scale businesses and financial institutions to meet the deadlines. The FTC voted unanimously to approve this deadline extension.</p>

<h2>Reasons for FTC data security rule updates</h2>

<p>The changes to the Financial Data Security Rule are meant to ensure that financial institutions put sufficient security measures in place to keep their customers&rsquo; personal information safe from any hacking attempts. Boosting the data security of financial institutions is vital to strengthening the overall cybersecurity of the country&rsquo;s interconnected financial networks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the increasing rates of identity theft and financial fraud attempts, this is an essential form of protection. In 2021, for instance, the FTC encountered <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/are-credit-cards-safer-than-debit-cards/" target="_blank">almost 390,000 reports</a> of credit card fraud alone, making this the most common type of financial fraud in the United States. Since credit card fraud can often be enacted during unsecured store transactions, the FTC is determined to bolster security measures at every level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FTC Safeguards Rule updates apply to in-person businesses, <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/the-biggest-concerns-within-the-us-financial-sector-in-2022" target="_blank">financial institutions</a>, and online platforms, including the more recent cryptocurrency industry. Since 2009, <a href="https://www.compareforexbrokers.com/forex-trading/statistics/" target="_blank">more than 6,600</a> distinct cryptocurrencies have been released. With such a sustained influx of different cryptocurrencies, regulations have been slow to catch up in comparison to other trading platforms such as forex or options trading. Now the FTC is working to ensure that online and cryptocurrency transactions are sufficiently secure.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What does this mean for businesses?</h2>

<p>Businesses and financial institutions will need to get busy implementing the necessary changes. For example, companies may need to update their software to <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/solutions/it-compliance-management" target="_blank">remain in compliance</a> with the updated FTC rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This process can take time, as companies will need to search for highly capable technical writers to document the software adjustments. According to Shaun Connell,<a href="https://freelancewritingjobs.com/how-create-software-documentation/" target="_blank"> technical writers and documentation creators</a> must be involved in the software update project from the start. So to meet the June deadline, businesses will need to make this security update a top priority.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who does it affect?</h2>

<p>Banks are not affected by The Safeguards Rule, but any other non-banking financial institutions, including motor vehicle dealers, payday lenders, and mortgage brokers, will need to update their security protocols by the deadline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on the specific institution and its pre-existing security setup, businesses may need to create, enact, and upkeep a strong security system that will protect their customers&rsquo; sensitive information, such as financial details, home address, personal preferences, and even name, age, and gender.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cybercriminals can use any and all of this information to steal customers&rsquo; identities, so <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/10-steps-to-creating-a-secure-it-environment" target="_blank">setting up a comprehensive security protocol</a> will ensure that customers&rsquo; details are safe throughout every transaction.</p>

<h2>Specific provisions under the extended deadline</h2>

<p>Not all the updated criteria of the Safeguards Rule are affected by this six-month-long extended deadline. The specific provisions that businesses and financial institutions must enact by June 9, 2023, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Appoint a highly qualified individual to oversee the new information security program.</li>
	<li>Encrypt all sensitive information that passes through a business&rsquo;s servers and systems.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Appoint and train security personnel who can manage and oversee the updated security systems and enact any security protocols in case of a cybersecurity breach.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Craft an incident response plan so that clear protocols are established.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Write a comprehensive risk assessment of their current security system.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enact ongoing monitoring of who has access to sensitive customer details within the company.</li>
	<li>Limit who has access to sensitive customer details within the company.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Set up <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> for any company member who attempts to access customer data. Or, instead of multi-factor authentication, another authentication system that provides equal protection can be implemented.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Conduct periodic assessments of the security practices used by their service providers to ensure added layers of security between businesses as well.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures may require significant lead times to be well-established and running effectively by the June deadline. But once they are set up, they should provide significant additional security for all business-to-customer interactions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Government policies to prevent cybersecurity threats</h2>

<p>At the core of these required security protocol updates is protection for customers. These necessary government policies have individual consumers&rsquo; security in mind and rely on multiple layers of cooperation and adjustment to keep sensitive data safe. Businesses and financial institutions will have to cooperate with the widespread Safeguards Rule implementation to fulfill federal trade commission standards designed to <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2022/cyberthreat-tips.html" target="_blank">prevent cybersecurity threats</a> from taking effect.</p>
