Cyber threats show no sign of slowing down, which is why it is important to stay up to date on security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the many reasons why we are so passionate about partnering with the Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana to help girls be more cyber aware. Girl Scouts is a volunteer led organization that stretches from coast to coast to help girls bring their dreams to life and build a better world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Together, we aim to educate Girl Scouts through lessons that focus on simulations of existing and emerging cyber threats, how to safely preserve important files and memories and what to look out for when browsing online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Becoming a cyber hero&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/06/13/girl-scouts-and-opentext-empower-future-leaders-of-tomorrow-with-cyber-resilience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;Cyber Resilience patch program&lt;/a&gt; provides Girl Scouts with the opportunity to engage in fun and educational hands-on activities that ignite awareness and create better online behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last month, we joined the Girl Scouts at their annual Cookie Rally that had over 2,000 girls and their families in attendance. We shared cybersecurity and safe online practices with the girls before they kicked-off their cookie season. While selling cookies is done primarily via in-person buying, selling cookies online has grown in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past October we kicked off our first patch program for the Brownies (grades 2-3) and Juniors (grades 4-5) and through a series of fun activities, the girls can learn how to navigate online dangers and stay safe online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning! We are in the process of rolling out more programs to teach more girls (and age groups) about the importance of cybersecurity and being safe online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interested in learning more about our security products?

They lead people on with talk of love and then attempt to trick them into giving money or personal data. As demonstrated by The Tinder Swindler, anyone at any age can be manipulated into a romance scam.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dating sites and apps are a convenient and easy way to find a match. They also present an ideal opportunity to fool unsuspecting hearts with common scams like: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;pretending to be in a financial crisis&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;li&gt;living out of state (and needing money to travel to meet you)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;li&gt;always having an excuse as to why they can’t meet in person&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all tactics are as obvious as the above. Be suspicious of someone who asks you to move your communication off the dating site/app to a different platform; this could be a sign that the person is trying to avoid detection, being flagged or that they want to share a malicious link for you to click on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To protect your heart, data and identity while online dating:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never give money or private data like birth dates and bank account numbers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trust your instincts; if it feels too fast or good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often claim to have fallen in love very quickly or without having met their “match” in person.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don’t send intimate pictures or videos. Scammers may use them to extort money from you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don’t share your address, daily routine or places you visit frequently&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a dating site/app that offers security features, such as the ability to verify the identity of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do your research, consider using a background check service to verify a person’s identity. And don’t forget about your own identity. Enroll in an identity and data protection service to further protect yourself.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Webroot antivirus with Allstate Identity Protection provides the much-needed extra layers to protect your data and identity from scammers looking for more than your heart.&amp;nbsp; To learn more visit webroot.com&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2023/02/14/online-romance-scams-take-aim-at-your-heart-and-identity-avoid-these-red-flags/\"&gt;Online Romance Scams Take Aim at Your Heart and Identity. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Avoid these Red Flags&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog\"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n"}},{"title":"Forget the Gym – Start 2023 Right by Getting Your Digital Life in Shape","link":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2023/01/04/forget-the-gym-start-2023-right-by-getting-your-digital-life-in-shape/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Tyler Moffitt"},"pubDate":"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 18:02:08 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Threat Lab"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/?p=31915"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"&lt;p&gt;The welcoming of a new year also welcomes the return of one of the most overused sayings in our shared lexicon: “New Year, New Me!” While there are countless overused resolutions like starting a workout regimen, the new year does provide an opportunity for additional self-improvement that most people never consider – bolstering cybersecurity protections.

Rather than take a vacation to spend their holiday earnings, cybercriminals are using the new year as a prime opportunity to access bank accounts, install malicious software, and steal identities to commit fraud.

We’re all rushing around trying to find the right gift that doesn’t break the budget. Throw in family time and stress can get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this time also marks one of the busiest times of year for online hackers. With the flurry of activity online, they know they’ve got ample targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all targets are equal. Hackers would rather make a quick buck than spend their time forcing their way through in-depth security. That’s why it’s so important to follow the 5 most important rules for online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Strengthen your passwords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason to still use the same password you came up with in high school. It’s a dirty truth that big businesses suffer data breaches – that means the longer you use a password the more likely it’s been hacked. Even if you’re not using that old website, hackers might know your information and will try logging in to common sites using your old email + password combination. We know it can be a pain to keep track of everything, and that’s why we recommend using a password manager service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Visit reputable sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all want to score the best deals on holiday shopping, but the old adage is true – if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. You don’t need to go to sketchy sites to find the best prices. The biggest retailers have deals all season long. Plus, when you use a big site you don’t run the risk of getting a knockoff product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Protect your WiFi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much of our life is on the go, and holiday shopping is no different. Did you know that WiFi networks are often targeted by hackers and scammers? Even the one in your home can be spoofed, allowing thieves to steal your information. That’s even more true when you’re connected at the local coffee shop. With a VPN (Virtual Private Network – something all the best antivirus options offer), your information is secure no matter where you connect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Invest in antivirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get what you pay for doesn’t just apply to your shopping. If you really want to make sure you’re safe online during the holidays, you want to make sure to invest in a reputable antivirus. No one wants a knock-off gifts – they’re low quality and unreliable. So why would you settle for a knock-off antivirus? Look for an option that has lots of good reviews, or even better go to a big box store and ask their experts for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It pays to be suspicious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;A healthy amount of suspicion can go a long way in protecting yourself while you’re shopping online (and let’s not get started on the sketchy ads we all get on social media). It’s always important to trust your gut. It’s also important to be wary of free money, unexpected calls from financial institutions and sites asking for personal information (rather than just billing info). And let’s not get started on the sketchy ads we all get on social media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holiday shopping can be stressful enough, don’t let it get worse with a stolen credit card or hacked computer. Follow the 5 most important rules for staying safe online and you can shop worry free and get back to celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interested in learning about award-winning antivirus?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av\"&gt;Discover Webroot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/11/29/the-5-most-important-rules-for-online-shopping/\"&gt;The 5 most important rules for online shopping&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog\"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n"}},{"title":"Webroot™ Premium: The all-in-one protection for your devices and identity","link":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/11/17/webroot-premium-the-all-in-one-protection-for-your-devices-and-identity/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Sabrina Lavi"},"pubDate":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 16:50:00 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Threat Lab"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/?p=31881"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"&lt;p&gt;The risk of becoming a victim of identity theft has never been greater We are increasingly living our lives in the digital realm.

Whether we’re banking, purchasing or browsing, our daily activities are most likely taking place online. Not only has this sped up our efficiency, but it has also expanded our exposure to a host of cybercriminals who are eager to use our personal information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the Federal Trade Commissioner (FTC), incidents of identity theft and related fraud rose nationwide in the United State in 2021. &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/consumers-lost-5point8-billion-to-fraud-last-year-up-70percent-over-2020.html\"&gt;Consumers lost more than 5.8 billion&lt;/a&gt;, skyrocketing over 70% from the previous year. The FTC received &lt;a href=\"https://identitytheft.org/statistics/\"&gt;5.7 million fraud and identity theft reports&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. Over a million of these reports were consumer identity theft cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rise in identity theft and fraud means it’s especially important to secure not only the devices you use but also your personal identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your identity is unique to you.

The looming recession and inflation have created financial uncertainty. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-040a\"&gt;global rise&lt;/a&gt; in sophisticated ransomware threats and geo-political tensions are &lt;a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-06-10-how-geopolitics-impacts-the-cyber-threat-landscape\"&gt;escalating cyber threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With so many factors and pressures at play, how are SMBs navigating this challenging business landscape while fighting back against cybercriminals?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insight from OpenText Security Solutions’ 2022 Global Ransomware SMB Survey sheds light on security priorities, concerns and posture. Feedback from SMBs across multiple industries and countries confirm security teams and the C-suite are worried about increasingly sophisticated and relentless attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware is a top concern for SMBs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming majority (88%) of SMBs indicated they are concerned or extremely concerned about an attack impacting their businesses. This worry is heightened by increasing geopolitical tensions. In fact, more than half (52%) of respondents now feel more at risk of suffering a ransomware attack due to these unfolding events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;SMBs’ ransomware concerns are already becoming a reality. Nearly half (46%) of SMBs have experienced a ransomware attack. Meanwhile, 66% of respondents are not confident or only somewhat confident that they can fend off a ransomware attack. Budget constraints and small security teams were cited as the primary roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite concern, security awareness training is infrequent:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of SMBs believe a successful ransom attack is the result of someone clicking on a malicious link or opening an email attachment. Yet despite this knowledge of users as the preferred attack surface, many SMBs (based on action) don’t view their employees as a first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixty-seven percent of SMBs conduct security awareness training twice a year or less. Of these SMBs, 31% conduct security awareness trainings only once a year; 10% only if an employee fails a phishing test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of small security budgets getting smaller:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixty-seven percent of SMBs spend less than $50,000 annually on cybersecurity. While 59% reported plans to increase their security budget in 2023, 57% fear inflation will lead to a change in plans resulting in budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMB security teams are spread thin; MSPs are an appealing option:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The majority (68%) of SMBs have fewer than five people on their security team. To help alleviate resource constraints, more than half (58%) of respondents use external security management support. In the future, 65% of SMBs that don’t currently use a managed services provider (MSP) for their security needs would consider doing so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Fighting more, with less&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adversaries have become increasingly sophisticated and relentless as the surface area of attacks only grows. Meanwhile, fear of looming budget cuts impacting already over-stretched security teams put SMBs in a vulnerable position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ongoing education and awareness of new attack vectors and defense against common channels such as email are critical for achieving a cyber resilience posture. Monthly phishing simulations are a great way to keep users current and accountable. A multi-layered approach that includes email security, DNS filtering, endpoint protection, and backup and recovery is essential to mitigating risk and exposure from attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn more, go to: &lt;a href=\"https://www.opentext.com/products/security-cloud\"&gt;https://www.opentext.com/products/security-cloud&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/11/07/opentext-security-solutions-2022-global-smb-ransomware-survey-fighting-more-with-less/\"&gt;OpenText Security Solutions 2022 Global SMB Ransomware Survey: Fighting More… with Less&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog\"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n"}},{"title":"Discover 2022’s Nastiest Malware","link":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/10/14/discover-2022s-nastiest-malware/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Tyler Moffitt"},"pubDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:13:00 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Threat Lab"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/?p=31873"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"&lt;p&gt;For the past year, hackers have been following close behind businesses and families just waiting for the right time to strike.

But this year also saw the onset of the triple extortion method – with this type of attack, hackers threaten to steal your data, leak it and then also execute DDoS attack if you don’t pay up. As a result, many organizations are shifting away from cyber insurance and adopting layered defenses in an effort to achieve cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ransom payments continued to balloon – last year at this time the average was just below $150,000 but it now stands close to $225,000 (that’s increasing faster than the rate of inflation, for those counting at home!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In bad news (as if we needed more), malicious actors seem to have settled on a favorite target: small and medium sized businesses. Large-scale attacks make headlines, but hackers have found that smaller environments make for easier targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it’s not all bad news… after all, the first step in defeating your enemy is to learn their tactics. Our researchers have been hard at work uncovering the worst offenders to better build defenses against them.

A Girl Scout develops a strong sense of self, displays positive values, seeks challenges and learns from setbacks. I had the absolute honor of spending 3 days with the Girl Scouts in Chicago at the annual Camp CEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Camp CEO is a chance for the Girl Scouts to meet, talk to, and connect with the mentors who attend. More than that, though, it gave me a chance to learn from these girls. I was changed for the better after attending this camp. The girls shared their aspirations and fears. They were vulnerable with all of us, and grew tremendously even in the short time we spent together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;On day one, the girls were excited but hesitant. I remember that feeling at an event similar to this one, first day of school, even family and friend’s gatherings. It really had me reflecting on my career growth as well as my personal growth. I would not be where I am without key influential women in my life whether that be family, friends, or colleagues. I knew that I owed it to these girls to share about my successes as well as my failures and how I got there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to make a meaningful connection, I wanted to first start by listening. Hearing firsthand the fears and goals they have was moving. While each girl had mentioned something different, there was a commonality there. Fears included things caused by lack of confidence, inability to problem-solve, and well-being of the community. While goals included things that require self-confidence, the ability to problem-solve, and the health of the community surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why this meant so much to me is each girl started the camp with more of a sense of doubt. This showed itself when they would hesitate to speak up, ask questions, or share an opinion. After we as mentors were able to lead by example and strike up conversations around us, share that we have had the same fears they feel now, and how we still experience them today and it’s okay to, we saw a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;What an incredible thing to see a change in a group of young women who will one day be our leaders, all within 3 days. By day 3, these girls were speaking before being asked to, making sure they voiced their opinions, and asked questions to learn how they can better themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spending time talking about and connecting around our stories really opened the door for these girls to understand it is okay to try when you’re scared, if anything, it is better to push yourself towards what you want. And along the way, you may look back and be shocked at where you landed. Having confidence in your values will assure you are always making the difference you are striving to make.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an honor to meet these girls and be able to give back by sharing my own teachings and experiences. While Camp CEO is meant to connect the Girl Scouts with resources they find in the mentors, I gained a resource and friend in each of these girls and cannot wait to celebrate them for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/09/12/spending-time-with-the-girl-scouts-of-greater-chicago-at-northwest-indianas-campceo/\"&gt;Spending time with the Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago at Northwest Indiana&amp;#8217;s CampCEO&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog\"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n"}},{"title":"New Research Exposes Hidden Threats on Illegal Streaming Sites","link":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/09/09/new-research-exposes-hidden-threats-on-illegal-streaming-sites/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Tyler Moffitt"},"pubDate":"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 12:32:06 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Threat Lab"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/?p=31811"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"&lt;p&gt;Regional restrictions on NFL game broadcasts and rising membership fees on streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus are just some reasons why frustrated consumers turn to illegal streaming sites.

Even the most tech-savvy viewer can fall victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the NFL season kicking off and a host of &lt;a href=\"https://www.talkdistrict.com/best-fall-movies-and-shows/?keyword=fall%20movies&amp;amp;utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=US%20Campaigns&amp;amp;utm_term=fall%20movies&amp;amp;utm_content=Best%20Fall%20Movies%20and%20Shows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;new fall shows and movies&lt;/a&gt; rolling out, findings from the UK serve as a timely reminder to sports fans and movie enthusiasts around the globe to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-scaled.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-1024x446.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31831\" srcset=\"https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-1024x446.jpg 1024w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-300x131.jpg 300w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-768x334.jpg 768w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-1536x669.jpg 1536w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-2048x892.jpg 2048w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-800x348.jpg 800w, https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09064508/Webroot_Illegal-Streaming-Blog-image_AMER_EN-1080x470.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats are Real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/download_file/4907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from our threat team reveals the extent to which consumers are being exposed to fraud, dangerous scams, and explicit content on illegal sports streaming sites. Analysis of 50 popular “free-to-view” sites during several major sporting events uncovered that every single site contained malicious content, while over 40 percent of sites did not have the necessary security certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help you decide whether using illegal streaming websites are worth the risk, let’s dive into some of the threats our intelligence experts uncovered during their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking trojans&lt;/strong&gt;, a type of malware that is hidden under legitimate-looking software and designed to hack your bank accounts. For example, a banking trojan may be disguised as a mute button that, once clicked, automatically starts downloading a trojan onto your device. This type of malware acts extremely fast, and if your antivirus is not up to date, it may not recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing webpages&lt;/strong&gt;, the most common type of malicious threat, are websites designed to look legitimate to fool you into providing your credentials. These scams offer the ability to view premium content as long as you log into your email hub or another important account that would be later used for identity fraud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto scams&lt;/strong&gt;, an increasingly popular malware that targets crypto apps on your phone. Crypto scams typically appear as pop-ups or redirects that show users fake stories of local politicians or celebrities to lure people into sophisticated financial ploys. These scams can seem very real and sometimes even imitate popular media publishing sites to sell the lie and get you to share your bank details. Another common crypto scam on these sites is malicious extensions that pretend to be a wallet for popular coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit content&lt;/strong&gt; has surged on illegal streaming sites and it’s becoming more prevalent and more extreme each year. If you frequently lend your children your device beware, you be unknowingly exposing them explicit content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to stay safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals have a deep bag of tricks, but there are some red flags you can look out for. Most of the illegal sites analyzed ran HTTP as opposed to HTTPS. While the difference of a single letter may not seem like much, “S” is crucial as it indicates encryption. An HTTPS site isn’t a guarantee that a website is entirely safe. However, its absence should always serve as a red flag not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Illegal streaming sites also are flooded with pop-ups and redirects to grab your attention and convince you to click–don&amp;#8217;t! Links are pretty common and can be disguised as anything, making users highly vulnerable. And if an offer looks too good to be true, it usually is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid anything that wants to install an extension as part of the requirement to view content. This major red flag will typically lead to malware or phishing redirects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the best way to say safe is to avoid risky free-to-view sites. Reliable antivirus that blocks malicious webpages will prevent you from opening and falling victim to these sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/download_file/4907\"&gt;Click here to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/download_file/4907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;learn &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/download_file/4907\"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/09/09/new-research-exposes-hidden-threats-on-illegal-streaming-sites/\"&gt;New Research Exposes Hidden Threats on Illegal Streaming Sites&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.webroot.com/blog\"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n"}},{"title":"How to stop social engineering tactics","link":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/08/24/how-to-stop-social-engineering-tactics/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Kyle Machado"},"pubDate":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 21:24:19 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Business + Partners"},{"#cdata-section":"SMBs"},{"#cdata-section":"cyber resilience"},{"#cdata-section":"phishing"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.webroot.com/blog/?p=31801"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"&lt;p&gt;With social engineering now the #1 cause of cyberattacks, it’s imperative for you to learn how to stop social engineering attacks against your business.

After that, you need to learn how combining security layers like Endpoint Protection and Email Security makes the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read on and we’ll walk you through every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is social engineering and how does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social engineering tactics are based on a simple truth: it’s easier to hack a human than it is to hack a computer. That means social engineering attackers use deception and tricks to get their victims to willingly give up private information like logins, passwords and even bank info.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phishing is the most common type of social engineering attack, and it works by disguising emails as someone or something you trust. We would never click on an email with the subject line “Click here to get hacked,” but we might click on an email titled “Your Amazon purchase refund – claim now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does combining security layers prevent social engineering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forrester unleashed their researchers to find the best defense against social engineering. They recommend layered defenses for preventing social engineering strategies like phishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because social engineering attacks prey on the human element of cybersecurity, they’re very good at getting around single layers of protection. After all, locked doors only work when the bad guys don’t have a copy of the key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if your business is protected by both Email Security and Endpoint Protection, attackers can trick their way into an employee’s email password and still be foiled by Endpoint Protection. Or they might gain access to your network with an illicitly gained password, but Email Security stops their attack from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop social engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how social engineering works and the best defense against this type of cyberattack, you’re well on your way to stopping social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next step is making sure you have the right tools to stop cybercriminals in their tracks. Review your cybersecurity strategy to make sure you have multiple layers of protection like Email Security and Endpoint Protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interested in achieving cyber resilience and gaining a partner to help stop cyberattacks?
