The bigger battle may not be with Tehran—but within MAGA itself, as its identity fractures over the meaning of “America First.”</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-conflict-how-another-middle-east-war-is-ripping-maga-apart-will-trump-coalition-survive/articleshow/121971301.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-conflict-how-another-middle-east-war-is-ripping-maga-apart-will-trump-coalition-survive/articleshow/121971301.cms</guid><pubDate>2025-06-20T15:07:55+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-121971903,imgsize-43920.cms"/></item><item><title>'Fan of Les Miserables, 95 billion dollar empire': 10 interesting things about Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/121971088.cms" /&gt;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, faces escalating challenges amid Israeli strikes and regional instability.
