<p><a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >Israel</a> launched a strike Monday on the headquarters of Iranian state television outlet IRNA, interrupting a live broadcast and sending debris and dust swirling through the studio during a newscast.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian regime&#8217;s propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of residents in the area,&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz said <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934643151655899471"  target="_blank">in a statement</a>. &ldquo;We will defeat the Iranian dictator everywhere.&rdquo;</p>



<p>During the live transmission, IRNA anchor Sahar Emami was speaking when a loud explosion was heard.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;This sound you heard, it is the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness,&rdquo; she said, before the screen behind her went black. Emami was seen leaving the set as the airstrike hit. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-strikes-iranian-state-tv-building/3600753"  target="_blank">IRIB Organization building</a>, which houses IRNA&#8217;s headquarters in Tehran&rsquo;s District 3, had been subject to an <a href="https://x.com/IDFFarsi/status/1934604000239767898"  target="_blank">IDF-issued evacuation</a> notice hours earlier.</p>



<p>A senior official at the state broadcaster responded, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-state-tv-resumes-broadcasting-after-israeli-strike-vows-not-to-be-silenced/"  target="_blank">stating</a>:&ldquo;The regime [Israel] was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong><em> <a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel Gets the War It Wanted</a></em></p>



<p>The bombing marked an escalation as the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day. </p>



<p>Iranian missile strikes earlier Monday killed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-missile-attacks-nuclear-news-06-16-2025-c98074e62ce5afd4c3f6d33edaffa069"  target="_blank">at least eight people</a> in Israel, authorities said, raising the country&#8217;s death toll to <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">at least 24</a>. Iranian officials meanwhile reported that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">at least 224 people</a> have been killed since the hostilities began.</p>



<p>Israeli military officials said their forces had achieved &ldquo;full aerial control above Tehran&rdquo; and claimed to have destroyed <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wbidaqxe"  target="_blank">approximately one-third</a> of Iran&rsquo;s surface-to-surface missile launchers.</p>



<p>In turn, Iranian state media claimed the country is preparing for &ldquo;the largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil.&rdquo;</p>



<p>At the G7 summit in Canada, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to open dialogue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it&#8217;s too late,&#8221; <a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >Trump said</a>.</p>

<p>Smoke and missiles have lit up the skies in Israel and Iran in a fierce standoff triggered by fears over <a href="https://time.com/7294133/iran-israel-nuclear-program-attack/" >Tehran&rsquo;s expanding nuclear program</a>.</p>



<p>Since June 13, hundreds of military strikes have been exchanged as the two nations remain locked in a conflict that shows no signs of abating. </p>



<p>The ongoing exchange of attacks has brought the death toll to at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">224 in Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">24</a> in Israel. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://time.com/7294186/israel-warns-tehran-will-burn-deadly-strikes-traded-nuclear-program/" >Benjamin Netanyahu</a> claimed Monday that military forces are &ldquo;striking regime targets&mdash;unlike Iran&rsquo;s criminal regime, which targets civilians.&rdquo; </p>



<p>In Tehran, many residents are fleeing to safer areas, while in Israel, air raid sirens continue to sound, urging citizens to seek shelter.</p>



<p>The violence has also resulted in significant damage to residential buildings, power grids, and oil refineries.</p>

<p>The timeline for a resolution remains unclear. President Donald Trump expressed support for a nuclear arms deal in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232"  target="_blank">an early Sunday post</a> on Truth Social, suggesting he could help broker an agreement. Trump affirmed his backing of Israel&rsquo;s defense and <a href="https://time.com/7294360/trump-warns-iran-bloody-conflict-israel-death-toll-rises/" >said</a> he hopes to keep the U.S. out of the broader Middle Eastern conflict for now, <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" >though reports indicate</a> some level of military coordination between Israel and the U.S.</p>

<p>He also warned Iran against retaliating against the U.S., <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">stating</a>, &ldquo;if we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald Trump has urged Iran to pursue immediate talks with Israel to de-escalate hostilities, warning that <a href="https://time.com/7294609/iran-israel-war-pictures-strike/" >continued conflict</a> could have dire consequences. </p>



<p>&#8220;Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it&#8217;s too late,&#8221; the U.S. President told reporters Monday at the beginning of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G7 meeting in Canada.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The comments came after at least <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-missile-attacks-nuclear-news-06-16-2025-c98074e62ce5afd4c3f6d33edaffa069"  target="_blank">8 people were killed</a> in the latest round of Iranian missile strikes on Israeli cities. </p>



<p>The ongoing exchange of attacks has brought the regional death toll to at <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">least 24</a> in Israel and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">224 in Iran</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Israel achieves &ldquo;full aerial control&rdquo; above Tehran; Iran warns of massive retaliation</h2>



<p>Israel&rsquo;s military has &ldquo;achieved full aerial control above Tehran&rdquo; and destroyed roughly one-third of Iran&rsquo;s surface-to-surface missile launchers, <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wbidaqxe"  target="_blank">an Israeli government spokesperson</a> said Monday.</p>



<p>Air raid sirens were reported in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Tel Aviv&mdash;where two of the latest casualties <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">occurred</a>.</p>



<p>In response to the latest round of hostilities, Iranian state media claimed the country is preparing for what it called &ldquo;the largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil.&rdquo; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/israel-iran-conflict-2025-05.jpg" alt="Israel Iran Conflict" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The same outlets also reported that an Israeli airstrike hit Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah, western Iran, killing civilians. A spokesperson for <a href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85864611/Attacking-hospitals-is-gross-violation-of-international-rules"  target="_blank">Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry</a> called the attack a &ldquo;war crime&rdquo; and a violation of international law.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes however, Tehran is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/a-battered-iran-signals-it-wants-to-de-escalate-hostilities-with-israel-and-negotiate-9feab4ae?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhUjX53gwJRUlaREnijQ6N0jKwLNKTi2Pc_xPn4zBMjUOKmSEQz7kb1wvZs0RI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68504856&amp;gaa_sig=cwSmY-sKq-tgTAxAj02Myp2KcovhEF5dZpHl-fT1enHrXjM9X4sc7QsJgDZ0g-MBHNBl-RBVAimifRUyDlRLQA%3D%3D"  target="_blank">understood</a> to be signaling its interest in ending hostilities and resuming nuclear negotiations, sending messages to Israel and the United States via Arab intermediaries.</p>



<p>Oil prices fell more than $2 per barrel Monday amid the reports Iran is seeking to end the conflict.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Iranian state TV office hit in Israeli strike</h2>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=YQvKcMga autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>Israel attacked the offices of Iranian state TV IRNA Monday, interrupting a live broadcast and sending debris and dust through the studio.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian regime&#8217;s propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of residents in the area,&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934643151655899471"  target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will defeat the Iranian dictator everywhere,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>IRNA Anchor Sahar Emami is seen talking live, saying: &ldquo;This sound you heard, it is the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness,&rdquo; followed by a loud explosion and the screen behind her turning black.</p>



<p>Emami then leaves the studio set, as debris and dust fills the studio. Hours before the attack, the IDF issued <a href="https://x.com/IDFFarsi/status/1934604000239767898"  target="_blank">an evacuation notice</a> for Tehran&rsquo;s District 3, where the IRNA headquarters are located in the <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-strikes-iranian-state-tv-building/3600753"  target="_blank">IRIB Organization building</a>.</p>



<p>In response to the strike, a senior official at the state broadcaster <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-state-tv-resumes-broadcasting-after-israeli-strike-vows-not-to-be-silenced/"  target="_blank">has said</a>: &ldquo;The regime [Israel] was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump &lsquo;rejected Israeli plan to kill Iranian leader&rsquo;</h2>



<p>Trump also reportedly rejected a recent proposal from Israel to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-rejected-israeli-plan-kill-iran-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-sources/"  target="_blank">According to U.S. media citing unnamed officials</a>, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented the option to Trump during a call over the weekend.</p>



<p>In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu declined to confirm or deny the proposal.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There are so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I&rsquo;m not going to get into that,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1934513820480811229"  target="_blank">Netanyahu said</a>. &ldquo;But I can tell you I think we do what we need to do. We will do what we need to do, and I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump reiterated Sunday that the United States was not involved in the Israeli strikes that began <a href="https://time.com/7293906/trump-warning-iran-israel-strikes-death-destruction/" >early Friday</a>. In a post on Truth Social, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">he added</a>: &ldquo;We can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called for <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" >U.S. military involvement</a>, saying it &ldquo;would be in everyone&rsquo;s interests&rdquo; to target Iran&rsquo;s nuclear infrastructure. &ldquo;We trust that President Trump will do the right thing&mdash;not only for the United States but for the world,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-strikes-news-06-16-25-intl-hnk#cmbz0sdsf00003b6nmnm6103c"  target="_blank">Lapid said</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Putin and Erdogan condemn Israeli actions against Iran</h2>



<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israeli military actions during a phone call on Monday, according to the Kremlin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/putin-erdogan-condemn-israeli-actions-against-iran-phone-call-kremlin-says-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">the Kremlin also said</a> in a statement.</p>



<p>Erdogan also warned that Israel&rsquo;s June 13 airstrikes have placed the region&rsquo;s security &ldquo;at grave risk,&rdquo; according to <a href="https://tass.com/world/1973793"  target="_blank">Russian state news agency TASS.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nuclear agency warns of radiological and chemical contamination inside Iran&rsquo;s main nuclear site</h2>



<p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned Monday of potential radiological and chemical contamination at Iran&rsquo;s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz following Israeli airstrikes.</p>



<p>Radiation levels outside the site remain normal, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-16-june-2025"  target="_blank">told an emergency session in Vienna</a>. However, he stressed that the agency lacks critical technical information to assess the full extent of the damage.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Amid these challenging and complex circumstances, it is crucial that the IAEA receives timely and regular technical information about the facilities and their respective sites,&rdquo; Grossi said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without this access to information, the IAEA &ldquo;cannot accurately assess the radiological conditions and potential impacts on the population and the environment and cannot provide the necessary assistance,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Electrical facilities at the Natanz plant have been seriously damaged <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/director-general-grossis-statement-to-unsc-on-situation-in-iran-13-june-2025"  target="_blank">according to the IAEA</a>, including the main power supply building and back up generators which have been destroyed. </p>



<p>The agency has also reported that strikes appear to have only impacted facilities above ground, but have not been able to verify any damage to underground areas of the plant.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Experts say that&rsquo;s what authorities in Hong Kong may be counting on, as they intensify a democratic crackdown in the semi-autonomous Chinese region, quietly building off of moves that began years ago to align the once-democratic stronghold with the more authoritarian government of Beijing.</p>



<p>On June 12, Hong Kong authorities <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200951.htm"  target="_blank">conducted</a> a joint operation with China&rsquo;s national security officials in the city, raiding the homes of six people and the office of an organization suspected of &ldquo;collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.&rdquo; Just days before, Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000697.htm"  target="_blank">warned</a> against downloading a &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; mobile video game deemed to be &ldquo;endangering national security.&rdquo; And on June 10, the city&rsquo;s leader, John Lee, <a href="https://sc.isd.gov.hk/TuniS/www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000389.htm"  target="_blank">said</a> Hong Kong will ramp up &ldquo;national security&rdquo; screenings of food and entertainment establishments.</p>



<p>Since the Chinese Central Government passed <a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" >a controversial law in 2020</a> in response to widespread <a href="https://time.com/5605920/hong-kong-protests/" >anti-establishment protests</a> the year before, Hong Kong has steadily transformed from a place known for freer expression to one that Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist focused on Asia, described last month as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fortifyrights.org/eas-inv-oped-2025-05-23/"  target="_blank">police state</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the law, which penalizes a swathe of actions deemed critical of Hong Kong and China, was passed, officials from both parties in the U.S. at the time saw it as an infringement on democratic rights, and the U.S. imposed sanctions to try to mitigate the effects.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, however, has said little about what&rsquo;s unfolding in Hong Kong. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1906755807963681144"  target="_blank">said in March</a> that &ldquo;Beijing has broken its promises to the people of Hong Kong&rdquo; amid the crackdowns, and on March 31, the State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-six-individuals-for-undermining-hong-kongs-autonomy/"  target="_blank">sanctioned</a> six individuals related to the erosion of freedom in Hong Kong, including national security officials and the city&rsquo;s former police commissioner.</p>



<p>But critics say the U.S. response seems to end there, and the latest wave of actions in June have not been addressed.</p>



<p>The turmoil around the globe may be proving helpful for Hong Kong to fasttrack its crackdown. Eric Yan-ho Lai, a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, tells TIME that &ldquo;the rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, has favoured the Hong Kong government to expand national security governance in the city.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Lai also said the latest developments show that Hong Kong officials have since shifted to &ldquo;executive-led&rdquo; regulatory approaches to quell dissent, rather than arrests en masse.</p>



<p>Under Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, U.S. policy has so far focused on China, with Hong Kong often lumped in with the mainland. For example, enhanced scrutiny of <a href="https://time.com/7289945/us-china-trump-rubio-international-student-visa-restrictions-trade-negotiations/" >Chinese students&rsquo; visas</a> also covered those from Hong Kong. Hong Kong was also included in U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7292207/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-timeline/" >tariffs on Chinese goods</a>.</p>



<p>Experts <a href="https://time.com/7174087/trump-second-term-foreign-policy-asia-approach/" >previously told TIME</a> that Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, in hopes of negotiating with China on priorities like trade, may avoid measures aimed at non-economic areas, such as China&rsquo;s domestic democratic and human-rights concerns, that could potentially ruffle Trump&rsquo;s relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore,&nbsp; tells TIME he thinks members of the Trump Administration like Rubio are &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of what&rsquo;s happening in Hong Kong but that the Administration is &ldquo;most focused&rdquo; at the moment on its own domestic issues.</p>



<p>On that front, Beijing may also benefit, observers have noted in recent days, as increasingly authoritarian-resembling moves by the Trump Administration, including <a href="https://time.com/7291978/los-angeles-immigration-protests-trump-national-guard-deployed-newsom-backlash/" >sending troops to quell protests in Los Angeles</a> earlier this month and <a href="https://time.com/7294323/trumps-military-parade-took-over-washington-as-anti-trump-no-kings-protests-dominated-everywhere-else/" >hosting a military parade</a> over the weekend, cast the U.S. as comparatively hypocritical and weak, according to Chinese media.<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3314508/setting-sun-chinese-media-contrasts-us-pageantry-and-violence-trumps-parade-day"  target="_blank">Said one state-run outlet</a> about Saturday&rsquo;s lackluster parade: &ldquo;Democracy is struggling in the mud.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As Alex Colville and David Bandurski of the China Media Project <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2025/06/16/a-trump-card-for-chinas-media/"  target="_blank">put it</a>: &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s assault on democratic norms is an unexpected gift for China&rsquo;s leaders, and one that may in the long term prove costlier than any trade war or diplomatic standoff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The U.S. has repeatedly denied involvement in <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >Israel&rsquo;s initial attack against Iran</a>&mdash;a position that Iran has disputed as missiles continue to fly between the two countries and the risk of further escalation looms should the world&rsquo;s biggest military be pulled into the fight. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>A number of reports, however, suggest that the U.S. may have played a greater role than has officially been admitted. </p>



<p>Unnamed U.S. officials told multiple news outlets on Sunday that President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we&rsquo;re not even talking about going after the political leadership,&rdquo; one official told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-vetoed-an-israeli-plan-kill-irans-supreme-leader-us-officials-say-2025-06-15/"  target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>Israel has denied such a plan, but the reported rejection by Trump would indicate some amount of coordination between the U.S. and Israel.</p>

<p>The conflict has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">killed hundreds</a> and wounded more than a thousand since Friday in Iran and killed <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">at least 24</a> and injured hundreds in Israel.</p>



<p>The attack on Iran came amid protracted talks between the U.S. and Iran centered around <a href="https://time.com/7294133/iran-israel-nuclear-program-attack/" >Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program</a>. </p>



<p>Trump has <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232"  target="_blank">emphasized</a> finding a diplomatic solution to the conflict, touting his self-professed ability to broker peace, but Iran and Israel have so far shrugged off international calls for deescalation as both sides launched new attacks early Monday.</p>



<p>Iran has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., too, while Trump has <a href="https://time.com/7294360/trump-warns-iran-bloody-conflict-israel-death-toll-rises/" >warned</a>: &ldquo;If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.&rdquo; </p>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=YQvKcMga autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about U.S. involvement so far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&ldquo;Nothing to do with the attack&rdquo;</h2>



<p>Israel launched its attacks, dubbed &ldquo;Operation Rising Lion,&rdquo; early Friday, targeting Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities as well as <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/" >military leaders and nuclear scientists</a> and promising that strikes &ldquo;will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat&rdquo; of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Iran launched <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >retaliatory strikes</a> at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Friday evening and have continued to fire missiles at the country.</p>



<p>Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/15/solid-evidence-iran-says-us-bears-responsibility-for-israels-aggression"  target="_blank">said</a> Iran has &ldquo;solid evidence&rdquo; that the U.S. provided support for Israel&rsquo;s attacks. Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said in a <a href="https://x.com/IrnaEnglish/status/1933371705486950552"  target="_blank">statement</a> that the attacks &ldquo;could not have been carried out without coordination with and approval of the United States,&rdquo; adding that the U.S. will be &ldquo;held responsible for the dangerous consequences of Israel&rsquo;s adventurism.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The U.S. has denied any involvement in Israel&rsquo;s strikes, a position that the Trump Administration has repeated multiple times since Friday.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,&rdquo; Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a <a href="https://za.usembassy.gov/statement-from-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio/"  target="_blank">statement</a> released soon after the strikes started, describing the attack as &ldquo;unilateral action&rdquo; by Israel. Rubio admitted Israel had informed the Trump Administration of the attack, which both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-aware-israel-strikes-iran-beforehand-says-were-no-surprises"  target="_blank">reiterated</a>. The U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7293392/us-embassy-iraq-iran/" >evacuated</a> embassy staff from across the region the day before the attack last week.</p>



<p>In a post on Truth Social urging Iran to &ldquo;make a deal,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114675456780398208"  target="_blank">suggested</a> Friday that he was also aware of &ldquo;the next already planned attacks,&rdquo; which would be &ldquo;even more brutal.&rdquo; Later that day, when asked by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> if he was given a heads-up about the initial attacks by Israel, he suggested that description was an understatement, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/trump-to-wsj-u-s-was-aware-of-israel-s-plans-to-attack-iran-4613AzRhb9WHfBFytL8Y"  target="_blank">responding</a>: &ldquo;Heads-up? It wasn&rsquo;t a heads-up. It was, we know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But on Saturday night, following further strikes, Trump again <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">posted</a>: &ldquo;The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&ldquo;Clear U.S. green light&rdquo;</h2>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel&rsquo;s attack</a> had been months in the making. Reports in May of <a href="https://time.com/7287313/iran-israel-strike-report-nuclear-us-trump-history-context-explainer/" >Israel&rsquo;s preparations to strike Iran</a> suggested that the Trump Administration would not assist Israel in such an operation, especially as Washington was in the midst of negotiating a nuclear agreement with Tehran.</p>



<p>But news outlet <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/13/how-israel-executed-strike-iran-nuclear"  target="_blank">Axios reported</a> Friday that Israeli officials said the strikes were in fact coordinated with the U.S., claiming that the Trump Administration publicly pretended to oppose an Israeli attack but gave Israel a &ldquo;clear U.S. green light&rdquo; in private.</p>



<p>According to the latest reports, the U.S. has even intervened to shape the attack. U.S. officials told Reuters, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-attack-43e3b1ce47d12477ae4533c941386b75"  target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/15/politics/us-military-trump-israel-iran"  target="_blank">CNN</a>, and others that Israel had informed the Trump Administration of a credible plan to assassinate Khamenei and that the White House waved Israel off the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri later denied those reports, <a href="https://x.com/Lazar_Berman/status/1845829551357587636"  target="_blank">calling</a> them &ldquo;fake.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I&rsquo;m not going to get into that,&rdquo; Netanyahu said when asked about it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD4ZBIWpmKg"  target="_blank">Fox News</a> on Sunday. &ldquo;But I can tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The unclear messaging about the extent of U.S. involvement, however, could reflect mixed priorities between the U.S. and Israel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and an expert on U.S.-Iran relations, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5432480/israel-iran-war-trump"  target="_blank">told</a> NPR that &ldquo;clearly there had been coordination and some form of a green light&rdquo; by the Trump Administration for the Israeli strikes.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Trump is making a major gamble here, thinking that this actually will soften the Iranian position and make them capitulate,&rdquo; Parsi added. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t, what are his options? And this is where I think the Israelis are hoping that the Iranians will not capitulate and that will force the United States into the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Israel and Iran<a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" > continue to trade deadly missiles</a>, with the heightened conflict showing no signs of easing. Israel struck Mashhad Airport in east Iran on Sunday afternoon, completing its &#8220;<a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1934276948051595660"  target="_blank">longest-range strike</a>&#8221; conducted since the beginning of its Iran-focused operation. This came after Iranian missiles rained down on Israel overnight, into the early hours of Sunday morning. Israel was also active during those hours, expanding its military operation by completing an &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1934033330216825209"  target="_blank">extensive series of strikes on targets in Tehran</a> related to the Iranian regime&rsquo;s nuclear weapons project.&rdquo; </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>In the midst of the explosive scenes in the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to issue a stark warning to Iran, with whom the U.S. has, until the recent flare-up of this conflict, been engaged in talks with regarding a potential nuclear deal. </p>



<p>Trump used the public platform to state that the U.S. had &ldquo;nothing to do with&rdquo; the overnight attack on Iran. He once more warned Iran not to target the U.S. as part of its retaliation.<br><br>&ldquo;If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict,&rdquo; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Later on Sunday morning, Trump followed up with an additional statement, urging a de-escalation of the raging conflict and suggesting a possible U.S. intervention in making that happen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got <a href="https://time.com/7284654/india-pakistan-ceasefire-trump-us-mediation-kashmir-conflict-strikes/" >India and Pakistan</a> to make, in that case by using TRADE with the United States to bring reason, cohesion, and sanity into the talks with two excellent leaders who were able to quickly make a decision and STOP,&#8221; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232"  target="_blank">he said,</a> signing off his message with: &#8220;Make the Middle East Great Again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Trump doubled down on this during an interview with ABC later in the day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not involved in it. It&rsquo;s possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,&rdquo;<a href="https://x.com/rachelvscott/status/1934240419677684208"  target="_blank"> he said</a> of the <a href="https://time.com/7294202/grim-reality-conflict-iran-israel/" >Israel-Iran conflict</a>, adding there&#8217;s no strict &#8220;deadline&#8221; for Iran to come to the table over a nuclear deal.</p>



<p>Officials from Iran and the U.S. were set to meet in Oman&#8217;s capital of Muscat on Sunday for the next round of nuclear talks. Oman&#8217;s Foreign Minister <a href="https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/1933909335291428917"  target="_blank">Badr Albusaidi announced on Saturday afternoon</a> that, in light of the Israel-Iran active conflict, those talks would no longer be going ahead. This came after state television reported that Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-calls-nuclear-talks-with-us-meaningless-after-israeli-strikes/"  target="_blank">called nuclear talks with the U.S. </a>&ldquo;meaningless.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Trump had aired his grievances with the lack of completion regarding the Iran-U.S. nuclear talks earlier in the week, in response to Israel&rsquo;s initial launch of its military operation against Iran. &ldquo;I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to &#8216;just do it,&#8217; but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn&rsquo;t get it done,&rdquo; Trump<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114675456780398208"  target="_blank"> said</a>. &ldquo;Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn&rsquo;t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite Trump&rsquo;s eagerness to secure a nuclear deal swiftly, it remains to be seen if and how those talks will get back on track, especially as there seems to be no end in sight for this most recent flare-up in the Middle East.</p>



<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1933340443343008068"  target="_blank">said the strikes</a> from his military, part of Operation Rising Lion, &ldquo;will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Israeli residential areas were hit hard overnight into Sunday morning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a public statement as sirens called out across the country, saying that &ldquo;millions of Israelis are currently running for shelter.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As deadly missiles showered over civilians&rsquo; heads, both countries have reported respective casualties. After the overnight combat, the Israeli death toll has now risen to at least 13, including three minors, according to officials in the country. Meanwhile, per the Iranian authorities, at least 75 people have been killed in Iran. Dozens more have been injured.</p>



<p>Ahead of the latest exchange of missiles, Netanyahu hinted at what was to come in a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1933903971225346115"  target="_blank">video address</a> on Saturday evening. &ldquo;We have paved a path to Tehran. In the very near future, you will see Israeli planes, the Israeli Air Force, our pilots, over the skies of Tehran,&rdquo; he said, going on to warn that Israel &#8220;will strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah&rsquo;s regime.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hours before, Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened dire consequences if Iran&rsquo;s Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei didn&rsquo;t retreat. &ldquo;If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn,&rdquo; Katz said, after a meeting with Israeli military leaders.</p>



<p>As Israel unleashed its next series of strikes against Iran overnight, Katz said: &ldquo;Tehran is burning.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219544280.jpg" alt="ISRAEL-IRAN-CONFLICT" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>On Sunday afternoon, local time, Katz delivered another update, reaffirming that Israel&rsquo;s course of military action is far from over. &ldquo;I instructed the IDF to issue evacuation notices to residents in Tehran living near weapons production complexes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Iranian dictator is turning Tehran into Beirut and the residents of Tehran into hostages for the survival of his regime.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Katz doubled down, adding: &ldquo;The IDF continues to peel the skin of the Iranian snake with great force, from nuclear weapons to Tehran and everywhere else.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <em><a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel Gets the War It Wanted</a></em><br><br>Meanwhile, according to state media in Iran, the country&#8217;s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned of a &#8220;more severe&#8221; response if Israel continues its operation.</p>



<p>&#8220;The continuation of Zionist [Israeli] aggression will be met with a more severe and powerful response from the Iranian armed forces,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c93ydeqyq71t?post=asset%3A00bc0f5b-fd35-4e9d-bb01-30bc5c948843#post"  target="_blank">Pezeshkian is quoted as saying on Saturday,</a> reportedly during a phone call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>



<p>Amid the prolonged trade of deadly missiles between <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >Israel and Iran</a>, and with no immediate end in sight, there&rsquo;s rising concern that the conflict could spiral even further, directly involving other countries&mdash;an outcome that Trump and his fellow world leaders are likely desperate to avoid.</p>

<p>After striking back on Friday night, Iran launched a new wave of strikes toward Israel on Saturday morning. Now, the two countries continue to <a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >exchange deadly missiles</a> and threats, with fatalities and injuries reported on both sides. Iran followed through on its vow to <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >retaliate</a> after Israel carried out a &ldquo;precise and integrated preemptive strike&rdquo; against <a href="https://time.com/7294133/iran-israel-nuclear-program-attack/" >Iranian nuclear</a> facilities, <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/" >targeting military personnel and scientists.</a> </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1933903971225346115"  target="_blank">video address on Saturday evening</a>, local time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: &#8220;We have paved a path to Tehran. In the very near future, you will see Israeli planes, the Israeli Air Force, our pilots, over the skies of Tehran.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also warned that Israel &#8220;will strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah&rsquo;s regime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We have dealt a very severe blow to Iran&#8217;s main enrichment site and, if necessary, we will also hit it again,&#8221; Netanyahu maintained.</p>



<p>His comments come after Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday morning threatened severe consequences if Iran&rsquo;s Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei doesn&rsquo;t retreat. &ldquo;If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn,&rdquo; Katz said, after a meeting with leaders of the Israeli military.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian dictator is turning Iran&rsquo;s citizens into hostages and creating a reality in which they, especially the residents of Tehran, will pay a heavy price for the criminal attacks on Israeli civilians.&rdquo;</p>



<p>According to state media, Iran&#8217;s President, Masoud Pezeshkian, has warned of a &#8220;more severe&#8221; response if Israel continues its attacks.</p>



<p>&#8220;The continuation of Zionist [Israeli] aggression will be met with a more severe and powerful response from the Iranian armed forces,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c93ydeqyq71t?post=asset%3A00bc0f5b-fd35-4e9d-bb01-30bc5c948843#post"  target="_blank">Pezeshkian is quoted as saying,</a> reportedly during a phone call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <em><a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel Gets the War It Wanted</a></em></p>



<p>Israel reported that at least three people had died and dozens have been injured after Iranian strikes rained down on Tel Aviv and nearby cities. Iran&rsquo;s U.N. Ambassador <a href="https://youtu.be/L8Sna4Idtdg?t=37"  target="_blank">reported that over 70 people have been killed</a> and over 300 wounded as a result of the Israeli strikes. The escalation of <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >traded strikes</a> has raised concerns for civilians on both sides.</p>



<p>According to multiple outlets, Iranian state media reported on Saturday that<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c93ydeqyq71t?post=asset%3A587a9ba6-9ed2-47da-9d82-f1bde9b66194#post"  target="_blank"> Iran has warned the U.K., U.S., and France</a> not to defend Israel against Iranian drones or missiles. Iran reportedly said it will target ships and bases belonging to the those countries if that should happen.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Downing Street&mdash;the official residence of U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer&mdash;on Saturday reaffirmed Starmer&#8217;s goal to support a diplomatic resolution. It was revealed that Starmer had spoken to Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and &#8220;they discussed the gravely concerning situation in the Middle East and agreed on the need to de-escalate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Starmer also spoke with Netanyahu. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-call-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-13-june-2025"  target="_blank">Per Downing Street</a>, the &#8220;Prime Minister was clear that Israel has a right to self-defense and set out the U.K.&rsquo;s grave concerns about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme. He reiterated the need for de-escalation and a diplomatic resolution, in the interests of stability in the region.&#8221;</p>



<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke out shortly after Israel launched its initial operative strikes against Iran, announcing that the U.S. were not participants in the military action. &ldquo;Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran&hellip; Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/06/statement-from-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio/"  target="_blank">the statement read</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that President Donald Trump is &#8220;dialed in&#8221; on the escalating conflict and it&#8217;s being monitored closely.</p>



<p>&#8220;The American people can be assured that Trump is dialed in. This is not an autopen moment. We had that where the world saw our gaze distracted or not paying attention at all. President Trump is dialed in,&#8221; <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/defense-sec-hegseth-says-trump-dialed-in-israel-iran-conflict-not-time-autopen-moment"  target="_blank">Hegseth said,</a> referencing the Trump Administration&#8217;s ongoing <a href="https://time.com/7291354/trump-orders-investigation-into-biden-and-aides/" >&#8220;autopen&#8221; investigations</a>. &#8220;I get to see it every single day. He knows every single dynamic of what&#8217;s going on here, and I&#8217;ll tell you what he&#8217;s doing here. He&#8217;s putting America first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Additionally, Trump revealed on Saturday afternoon that President Vladimir Putin of Russia had called him earlier in the day, and that the two had discussed Iran at length. &#8220;He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end,&#8221; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114683261634430212"  target="_blank">Trump said</a>, referencing the on-going Russia-Ukraine war.</p>



<p>Trump also shared a phone call with British leader Starmer, where they &#8220;discussed the military action in the Middle East overnight and agreed on the importance of diplomacy and dialogue.&#8221;</p>



<p>France&#8217;s President Emmanuel Macron also publicly addressed the Middle East unrest, saying he had recently spoken with President Pezeshkian of Iran.</p>



<p>&#8220;In my first message, I called for the immediate release of our compatriots, Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who have been held hostage by the Iranian regime for more than three years in unacceptable conditions. Given the serious risk of instability across the region, I emphasized that our diplomatic facilities and citizens in Iran and the region must not be targeted under any circumstances,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1933945539923501464"  target="_blank">Macron said</a>. &#8220;I also called for maximum restraint to prevent an escalation of tensions. The issue of Iran&#8217;s nuclear program is a serious issue that must be resolved through negotiations. Therefore, I invited the President to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to reach an agreement, as this is the only way to reduce tensions.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219260443.jpg" alt="Israel Launches Strikes Against Iran" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1933626898242056488"  target="_blank">Netanyahu addressed the &ldquo;esteemed people of Iran&rdquo;</a> directly in a filmed statement on Friday night.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are in the midst of one of the largest military operations in history. The Islamic regime that has oppressed you for almost 50 years threatens to destroy our country, Israel,&rdquo; Netanyahu said. &ldquo;The goal of Israel&#8217;s operation is to prevent the Islamic regime&#8217;s nuclear and ballistic missile threats.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;While we achieve our goal, we also pave the way for you to achieve your freedom,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;In the past 24 hours, we have destroyed senior military commanders, prominent nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime&#8217;s most important enrichment facility, and a large part of its ballistic missile arsenal. Another operation is underway&rdquo;</p>



<p>Netanyahu went on to say that the regime in Iran has &ldquo;never been so weak&rdquo; and urged Iranians to use the opportunity to &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; and make their voices heard.</p>



<p>Israel&rsquo;s initial strikes on Iran in the early hours of Friday morning, local time, came amid long-time concerns as to the progression of the country&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities. The United States has been engaged in ongoing talks with Iran, in an effort to make a nuclear deal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219275957.jpg" alt="Iran launches retaliatory strikes against Israel" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Another round of talks between the U.S. and Iran was set to take place in the Sultanate of Oman&#8217;s capital of Muscat on Sunday, but they will no longer be going ahead.</p>



<p>Oman&#8217;s Foreign Minister <a href="https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/1933909335291428917"  target="_blank">Badr Albusaidi announced on Saturday afternoon</a>: &#8220;The Iran-U.S. talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place. But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.&#8221;</p>



<p>This comes after Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-calls-nuclear-talks-with-us-meaningless-after-israeli-strikes/"  target="_blank">called nuclear talks with the U.S. </a>&ldquo;meaningless,&rdquo; according to state television.</p>

<p>Trump on Friday issued a grave warning of his own to Iran, urging them to make a nuclear deal before the combat escalated further, which it since has. </p>



<p>Detailing how he has long sought to make an agreement with Iran, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114675456780398208"  target="_blank">Trump said</a>: &#8220;I told them, in the strongest of words, to &lsquo;just do it,&rsquo; but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn&rsquo;t get it done&hellip; Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn&rsquo;t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse.&#8221;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2216427690.jpg" alt="Finance Ministers And Central Governors' Meeting In Banff"/>



<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss the G-7, a club of wealthy democracies <a href="https://time.com/7292616/history-50th-g7-summit/" >set up in 1975</a> to coordinate trade and global economic policy. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/what-is-the-g7-1.7556129"  target="_blank">This year&#8217;s summit</a>&mdash;held on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Canada&mdash;comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is upending the global economy with <a href="https://time.com/7292207/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-timeline/" >tariffs</a> and has <a href="https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/" >repeatedly threatened</a> to make the host nation America&rsquo;s &ldquo;51st state.&rdquo; </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The G-7 is also an anachronism. It was set up five decades ago to include the world&#8217;s largest economies, but today China and India, two economic heavyweights, are not members. The G-7 has simply not kept pace as the global distribution of wealth and power shifts from West to East and North to South. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, the upcoming G-7 summit is still a valuable and promising diplomatic format. First, it brings together many of the world&rsquo;s leading democracies. If the liberal, rules-based international order is to survive and thrive, this collection of advanced democracies will need to play a prominent role. Trump seems determined to bring this order down, but the summit <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-13/trump-g-7-leaders-to-discuss-trade-russia-ukraine-iran-israel-middle-east"  target="_blank">offers a chance</a> for America&rsquo;s prized allies to talk him out of that, or at least limit the damage done. </p>



<p>Second, the G-7 is small and informal, enabling it to foster sustained dialogue and build consensus. The G-7 in important respects resembles the 19th century Concert of Europe, a steering group of major powers that had no charter or formalized procedures, but relied on ad hoc consultation and coordination to preserve great-power peace over decades.</p>



<p>At a time when geopolitical division hamstrings large and formal bodies like the U.N. and World Trade Organization, small and informal contact groups are becoming the diplomatic vehicles of choice. Although a clutch of other countries&mdash;including <a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/canada-invites-united-arab-emirates-to-g7-summit-brazil-says-carney-invited-to-cop30/article_d60ffd09-aaab-5a6c-a952-68be855e94d3.html"  target="_blank">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/modis-g7-visit-can-india-canada-reset-strained-ties/a-72894633"  target="_blank">India</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-attend-g7-hopes-meet-president-trump-2025-06-12/"  target="_blank">Ukraine</a>&mdash;are expected to attend the G-7 as guests, the format lends itself to intimate and constructive conversation. When it comes to getting things done, small is beautiful.</p>



<p>The world&rsquo;s wealthiest democracies are not alone in turning to bespoke and informal groupings to conduct diplomacy. Indeed, China and Russia have been leading the effort to form steering groups, such as the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-brics-group-and-why-it-expanding"  target="_blank">BRICS</a>, to serve as counterweights to the G-7 and other bodies dominated by the West. The BRICS includes not just autocracies like China and Russia, but also developing democracies like Brazil, India, and South Africa.</p>



<p>The G-7 and BRICS are suspicious of each other, in a way that splits the major powers into competing diplomatic camps. Yet such division is a huge problem in an interdependent world that faces collective challenges&mdash;including climate change, nuclear proliferation, pandemics, and the threats posed by AI. The G-20&mdash;which includes democracies and autocracies as well as developed and developing economies from all parts of the world&mdash;exhibits the diversity that is needed. But it is also too big and bulky, and its summits produce only anodyne communiques. </p>



<p>So what should come next?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The way forward is more bespoke groupings like the G-7 that focus on specific challenges. One could focus on ending the war in Ukraine; a second on ending the current war in the Middle East; a third on tackling climate change; and a fourth on the growing threat posed by unregulated AI. Such concerts should include democracies and non-democracies alike, bridging, rather than deeping, ideological and geopolitical divides. </p>



<p>These bespoke groupings would not supplant the U.N. and other international bodies. They would backstop them by providing a forum for a sustained dialogue that is hard to come by in big and bureaucratic institutions. And they would tee up decisions that would be implemented in more official settings. </p>



<p>It is precisely this function that the G-7 summit should aim to fulfill. At the top of the agenda will be Ukraine and trade. If Trump is to succeed in his effort to end the war in Ukraine, he will need to confront Vladimir Putin with tighter economic sanctions and more weapons for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-trump-meeting-g7-war-russia-putin-defense/"  target="_blank">hoping for a meeting</a> with Trump in Kananaskis, a conversation that can help set the stage for a successful NATO summit in The Hague later this month, where the big item on the agenda is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crljpwnr220o"  target="_blank">defense spending</a>.</p>



<p>On trade, the world is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg4v9nr23r7o"  target="_blank">teetering on the edge of a precipice</a>. A 90-day pause on Trump&rsquo;s sweeping &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs ends on July 8, and some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bessent-says-us-may-roll-date-forward-some-after-90-day-tariff-pause-ends-2025-06-11/"  target="_blank">17 nations</a> are still reportedly in trade talks. The summit will give G-7 members&mdash;who still account for more than half of global GDP&mdash;an opportunity to get Trump to back away from the ledge. </p>



<p>The world is at a dangerous inflection point as the demand for global governance increasingly outstrips its supply. The U.N. and other existing institutions have an important role to play&mdash;but they are not enough on their own. They need to be complemented by a system of concerts aimed at facilitating compromise, cooperation, and collective action. </p>



<p>The G7 is one of those. Let&#8217;s hope more of them follow.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Fertility-Report-UN.jpg" alt="Mother uses her hand to hold her baby's tiny hand to make him feeling her love, warm and secure. Newborn."/>



<p>People across the world have been having <a href="https://time.com/6970873/us-declining-birth-rate-2023-total/" >fewer and fewer children</a>, and it&rsquo;s not always because they don&rsquo;t want them.</p>



<p>The global fertility rate has, on average, dropped to less than half what it was in the 1960s, the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2025_wfr_2024_final.pdf"  target="_blank">has found</a>, falling below the &ldquo;replacement level&rdquo; required to maintain the current population in the majority of countries.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Amid that historic decline, nearly 20% of adults of reproductive age from 14 countries around the globe believe they won&rsquo;t be able to have the number of children they want to, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN&rsquo;s sexual and reproductive health and rights agency, said in a <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/swp25-layout-en-v250609-web.pdf"  target="_blank">report</a> released this week. For most of them, the report found it isn&rsquo;t infertility keeping them from doing so. They pointed to factors including financial limitations, barriers to fertility or pregnancy-related medical care, and fears of the state of the world that they say are hindering them from making their own fertility and reproductive choices.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of people out there who are willing to have children&mdash;and have more children than they have&mdash;if the conditions were right, and the government&rsquo;s obligation is to provide those measures of well-being, of welfare, which enable good work-life balance, secure employment, reduce the legal barriers, provide better health care and services,&rdquo; says Shalini Randeria, the president of the Central European University in Vienna and the senior external advisor for the UNFPA report. But she says policies that some governments are implementing&mdash;such as cutting Medicaid in the U.S. and enforcing restrictions on reproductive health and autonomy&mdash;are both a step backward for people&rsquo;s rights and &ldquo;counterproductive from a demographic point of view.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><em><a href="https://time.com/6965267/women-having-kids-later/" >Why So Many Women Are Waiting Longer to Have Kids</a></em></p>



<p>For the report, UNFPA conducted a survey, in collaboration with YouGov, of people in 14 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Africa that, together, represent more than a third of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There is a gap between the number of children people would have liked to have had and the number they had,&rdquo; Randeria says. &ldquo;For us, it was important to then figure out&mdash;by asking them&mdash;what it is that causes this gap.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial barriers</strong></h2>



<p>The most significant barriers survey respondents identified to having the number of children they desired were economic: 39% cited financial limitations, 19% housing limitations, 12% lack of sufficient or quality childcare options, and 21% unemployment or job insecurity.</p>



<p>The prices for all kinds of goods and services have climbed precipitously in recent years. Global inflation reached the highest level seen since the mid-1990s in July 2022, according to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/global-inflation"  target="_blank">World Bank Group</a>. While it has declined since then, the current levels are still significantly above those seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/child-care-crisis/" >Why Affordable Childcare Is Out of Reach for So Many People</a></em></p>



<p>Rising costs have hit both housing and childcare hard. In the U.S., for instance, the Treasury Department has found that housing costs have <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/rent-house-prices-and-demographics"  target="_blank">increased faster than incomes</a> for the past two decades, surging about 65% since 2000 when adjusted for inflation. And research has found that the cost of child care in the U.S. has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/child-care-costs-more-than-rent-in-some-u-s-counties-feds-find/"  target="_blank">shot up</a> in recent years, <a href="https://blog.dol.gov/2024/11/19/new-data-childcare-costs-remain-an-almost-prohibitive-expense"  target="_blank">surpassing</a> what many Americans pay for housing or college.</p>



<p>The current housing crisis is impacting &ldquo;every region and country,&rdquo; the United Nations Human Settlements Programme said in a <a href="https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2024/10/2416772e.pdf"  target="_blank">report</a> last year, estimating that between 1.6 billion and 3 billion people around the world do not have adequate housing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reproductive obstacles</strong></h2>



<p>People cited other factors getting in the way of them having as many children as they want as well, including barriers to assisted reproduction and surrogacy.</p>



<p>Several countries&mdash;including France, Spain, Germany, and Italy&mdash;have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rmv63069o"  target="_blank">banned</a> surrogacy. The UNFPA report also points out that many countries restrict or ban access to assisted reproduction and surrogacy for same-sex couples. In Europe, for instance, only 17 out of 49 countries allow medically-assisted insemination for people, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the report.</p>



<p>The UNFPA <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/swp2025"  target="_blank">notes</a> that, as global fertility rates are declining, some governments are taking &ldquo;drastic measures to incentivize young people to make fertility decisions in line with national targets.&rdquo; But the report argues that the &ldquo;real crisis&rdquo; is &ldquo;a crisis in reproductive agency&mdash;in the ability of individuals to make their own free, informed and unfettered choices about everything from having sex to using contraception to starting a family.&rdquo;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/"  target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, 40% of women of reproductive age around the world live under restrictive abortion laws. Many countries&mdash;including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyxx17zeydyo"  target="_blank">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/asia/philippines-abortion-ban-debate-women-rights-roe-wade-intl-hnk-dst"  target="_blank">the Philippines</a>, and <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/un-cedaw-report-poland-abortion/"  target="_blank">Poland</a>, among others&mdash;have severely restricted abortion. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://time.com/6189476/abortion-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade/" >overturned</a> the landmark ruling <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>striking down the constitutional right to abortion. Since then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html"  target="_blank">more than a dozen states</a> have enacted near-total bans or restricted abortion. There have been many reports of pregnant people being <a href="https://time.com/7216391/amanda-zurawski-texas-reproductive-rights/" >denied</a> critical care because of state laws restricting abortions, and many women have <a href="https://time.com/7175184/idaho-near-total-ban-court-case/" >said they don&rsquo;t feel safe</a> being pregnant in states where abortion is banned.</p>



<p>And while a growing share of women around the world are having their family planning needs met, around 164 million still were not as of 2021, the UN <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2023/Feb/undesa_pd_2022_world-family-planning.pdf"  target="_blank">found</a> in a report released in 2022.</p>



<p>In addition to considering access to family planning a human right, the UN also <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/family-planning"  target="_blank">notes</a> that it is key to reducing poverty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fear for the future</strong></h2>



<p>About 14% of respondents in the UNFPA report said concerns about political or social situations, such as wars and pandemics, would lead or have already led to them having fewer children than they had wanted. And about 9% of respondents said concerns about climate change or environmental degradation would lead or had already led to them having fewer children than they had desired.</p>

<p>Violence and conflict have been on the rise around the globe in recent years. The period between 2021 and 2023 was the most violent since the end of the Cold War, according to <a href="https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/sites/default/files/Data/reports/ap_FCV.pdf"  target="_blank">the World Bank Group</a>, and the numbers of both battle-deaths and violent conflicts have climbed over the past decade.</p>



<p>That violence has contributed to years of rising displacement: More than 122 million people across the world have been forcibly displaced, the UN&rsquo;s refugee agency <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/press-releases/number-people-uprooted-war-shocking-decade-high-levels-unhcr"  target="_blank">reported</a> Thursday, nearly double the number recorded a decade ago.</p>



<p>The impact of the global pandemic has been even more widely felt, and is unlikely to fade from anyone&rsquo;s memory any time soon as COVID-19 continues to spread, develop <a href="https://time.com/7289133/new-covid-variant-nb-181/" >new variants</a>, and take a toll on people whose recovery from the virus <a href="https://time.com/7292910/covid-symptoms-long-covid/" >can take months, or even years</a>. Even beyond COVID, outbreaks of infectious diseases are becoming <a href="https://time.com/6211430/infectious-disease-outbreaks-polio-covid-19/" >more commonplace</a>&mdash;and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9175207/"  target="_blank">experts predict</a> that, in the years ahead, the risk of those outbreaks escalating into epidemics and pandemics will only rise.</p>



<p>In a 2024 <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/worlds-largest-survey-climate-change-out-heres-what-results-show"  target="_blank">UN Development Programme survey</a>, which statistically represents about 87% of the global population, about 56% of respondents said they were thinking about climate change on a daily or weekly basis. About 53% of the respondents also said they were more concerned about climate change now than they were a year before. A third of respondents said that climate change is significantly affecting their major life decisions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I want children, but it&rsquo;s becoming more difficult as time passes by,&rdquo; a 29-year-old woman from Mexico is quoted as saying in the report. &ldquo;It is impossible to buy or have affordable rent in my city. I also would not like to give birth to a child in war times and worsened planetary conditions if that means the baby would suffer because of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program suffered one of its most serious setbacks in years on Friday, after <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >Israel launched a series of airstrikes</a> on nuclear sites, top scientists, and military officials in a dramatic escalation of its long-running campaign to contain Tehran&rsquo;s atomic ambitions.</p>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >Israeli officials described the strikes</a> as a preemptive operation aimed at crippling Iran&rsquo;s ability to build a nuclear weapon, following what they called a sharp and alarming expansion of uranium enrichment over the past six months.<strong> </strong></p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Initial damage assessments indicate that the strikes on Iran&rsquo;s Natanz nuclear facility were particularly effective, knocking out the electricity on the underground area where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored, Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Friday. Natanz had been the centerpiece of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear infrastructure and the site where much of its uranium fuel has been produced.</p>



<p>On Friday evening, Iranian state media reported that Israel began striking Iran&rsquo;s other major enrichment site&mdash;Fordow, which is buried deep within a mountain and is considered nearly impervious to conventional airstrikes.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the campaign a &ldquo;strike at the head of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear weaponization program,&rdquo; and said it would continue &ldquo;as many days as it takes&rdquo; to eliminate the threat. Explosions were <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >reported</a> over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv Friday evening as Iran launched a broad retaliatory strike against Israel.</p>



<p>Iran has insisted that it is not developing a bomb and that its nuclear program remains non-weaponized for peaceful energy purposes, though international inspectors have found increasing evidence to the contrary. The United Nations&rsquo; nuclear watchdog reported that Iran&rsquo;s stockpile of 60% enriched uranium&mdash;just below weapons-grade&mdash;has grown large enough to produce multiple bombs if further enriched. Analysts say Iran could theoretically produce a bomb&rsquo;s worth of material in as little as a week, and that no other country has that level of uranium without a nuclear weapons program.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This really was done as a last resort,&rdquo; says Matt Kroenig, the senior director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Scowcroft Center on international security who served in the Department of Defense and the intelligence community during the Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations. &ldquo;They were out of time. The best estimates were that Iran&#8217;s dash time to one bomb&#8217;s worth of weapons grade material was down to about a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program get this far?</h2>



<p>Iran&rsquo;s nuclear journey began with American support. In 1957, the United States helped launch Iran&rsquo;s atomic energy program under President Eisenhower&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atoms for Peace&rdquo; initiative, when the two nations were allies. By the 1970s, Iran was working on nuclear reactors with U.S. and European assistance, but that partnership collapsed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>



<p>Since then, the U.S. has watched with alarm as Iran pursued nuclear capabilities, largely in secret. The Natanz site has been a focal point of that concern. In the early 2000s, it was revealed as part of a covert network of nuclear sites that Iran had failed to disclose to international inspectors.</p>



<p>Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful, aimed at energy production and medical research. It is also a party to the UN&rsquo;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which obliges members not to develop nuclear weapons. But international watchdogs have warned about the country&rsquo;s enrichment of uranium to levels far beyond civilian use and its concealment of key facilities.</p>



<p>Tensions escalated when President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal reached under President Barack Obama, an agreement that rolled back much of Iran&rsquo;s enrichment activity, capped its uranium stockpile, and subjected its facilities to rigorous international inspections. Trump had called the deal &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo; and instead initiated new sanctions on the regime to cripple its economy.</p>



<p>But Iran responded by gradually abandoning the agreement&rsquo;s restrictions and ramping up uranium enrichment. It also removed all of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) equipment that had been installed for surveillance and monitoring. By 2024, Iran had resumed operations at Natanz and Fordow at a pace not seen in over a decade, deploying more advanced centrifuges and enriching uranium to 60-percent&mdash;alarmingly close to the 90-percent purity required for a nuclear weapon.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Israel Gets the War It Wanted</em></a></p>



<p>In recent months, Iranian officials confirmed they were building a third enrichment site, further deepening concerns that Tehran was preparing to take its nuclear program underground and beyond the reach of future diplomacy or attack.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There are only really three key nuclear facilities [in Iran],&rdquo; says Jonathan Panikoff, the former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the National Intelligence Council, pointing to Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. &ldquo;If they succeed in destroying those three facilities, it will really set Iran&#8217;s nuclear program back.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Could Iran build a nuclear weapon&mdash;and how soon?</h2>



<p>Technically, Iran has not yet built a nuclear weapon. But the infrastructure and know-how are in place, analysts say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Israel&rsquo;s strikes, the IAEA found that Iran could enrich enough uranium for a bomb in about a week. That means that in five months, Iran could have had enough for 22 nuclear weapons. However, analysts note that uranium alone isn&rsquo;t enough for a viable nuclear weapon and that it would take additional time to manufacture it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219239303.jpg" alt="Israeli Attacks On Iran-Reactions" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Israel and the U.S. oppose a nuclear Iran</h2>



<p>Netanyahu believes that a nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat, claiming that Iranian leaders have openly called for the end of the Israeli state and have lent support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Eighty years ago, Jews were victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime. Today, the Jewish state refuses to be the victim of a nuclear Holocaust perpetrated by the Iranian regime,&rdquo; Netanyahu declared on Friday.</p>



<p>For Israel, the fear is not just a direct nuclear strike, but that Iran could act more aggressively throughout the region under the protection of a nuclear deterrent.</p>



<p>Trump, a strong ally of Israel, has insisted that Iran &ldquo;cannot have a nuclear weapon&rdquo; and framed the moment as a possible &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; for Iran&rsquo;s leadership to quickly reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program in order to avoid further destruction &ldquo;before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How has Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program been damaged?</h2>



<p>Israel&rsquo;s strikes on Friday marked the first overt attack on Iran&rsquo;s core nuclear infrastructure. While it remains unclear how Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program will ultimately be impacted, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Natanz, the facility at the heart of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambition, was destroyed in the strikes. Other major nuclear sites were not initially hit, though Grossi later noted that &ldquo;Iranian authorities are informing us of attacks on two other facilities, namely the Fordow fuel enrichment plant and at Isfahan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Several high-ranking <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/" >Iranian military officials</a> were also killed in the strikes, according to state-affiliated media, including six nuclear scientists and security forces tasked with protecting its nuclear sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But analysts note that Iran still likely retains much of its expertise and equipment. A full dismantling of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear infrastructure would likely require a sustained campaign involving not only air power, but also cyber warfare, intelligence operations, and potentially ground forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the deeply buried Fordow site&mdash;nearly half a mile inside a mountain&mdash;could be beyond the reach of Israel&rsquo;s current munitions. Only the U.S. is believed to possess the most advanced bunker-busting bombs capable of reliably penetrating such sites, says Panikoff.</p>
