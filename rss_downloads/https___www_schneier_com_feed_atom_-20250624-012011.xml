<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred.

Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine to another.</p>
<p>UDP flood attacks send extremely high volumes of packets to random or specific ports on the target IP. Such floods can saturate the target&#8217;s Internet link or overwhelm internal resources with more packets than they can handle.</p>
<p>Since UDP doesn&#8217;t require a handshake, attackers can use it to flood a targeted server with torrents of traffic without first obtaining the server&#8217;s permission to begin the transmission. UDP floods typically send large numbers of datagrams to multiple ports on the target system. The target system, in turn, must send an equal number of data packets back to indicate the ports aren&#8217;t reachable. Eventually, the target system buckles under the strain, resulting in legitimate traffic being denied.</p></blockquote>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/where-ai-provides-value.html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve worried that AI might take your job, deprive you of your livelihood, or maybe even replace your role in society, it probably feels good to see the latest AI tools fail spectacularly. If AI recommends <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">glue as a pizza topping</a>, then you&#8217;re safe for another day.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that AI already has definite advantages over even the most skilled humans, and knowing where these advantages arise&#8212;and where they don&#8217;t&#8212;will be key to adapting to the AI-infused workforce.</p>
<p>AI will often not be as effective as a human doing the same job. It won&#8217;t always know more or be more accurate. And it definitely won&#8217;t always be fairer or more reliable. But it may still be used whenever it has an advantage over humans in one of four dimensions: speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Understanding these dimensions is the key to understanding AI-human replacement.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>First, speed. There are tasks that humans are perfectly good at but are not nearly as fast as AI. One example is restoring or upscaling images: taking pixelated, noisy or blurry images and making a crisper and higher-resolution version. Humans are good at this; given the right digital tools and enough time, they can fill in fine details. But they are too slow to efficiently process large images or videos.</p>
<p>AI models can do the job blazingly fast, a capability with important industrial applications. AI-based software is used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15164112">enhance</a> satellite and remote sensing data, to <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16484">compress video files</a>, to make video games <a href="https://gtg.benabraham.net/nvidia-dlss-carbon-impacts-whats-the-cost-benefit-of-upscaling-frame-generation-and-neutral/">run better</a> with cheaper hardware and less energy, to help robots <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/725865">make the right movements</a>, and to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5127031">model turbulence</a> to help build better internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>Real-time performance matters in these cases, and the speed of AI is necessary to enable them.</p>
<h3>Scale</h3>
<p>The second dimension of AI&#8217;s advantage over humans is scale. AI will increasingly be used in tasks that humans can do well in one place at a time, but that AI can do in millions of places simultaneously. A familiar example is ad targeting and personalization. Human marketers can collect data and predict what types of people will respond to certain advertisements. This capability is important commercially; advertising is a <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-06-09/wpp-media-cuts-2025-global-advertising-revenue-growth-forecast-to-6-on-trade-concerns">trillion-dollar market globally</a>.</p>
<p>AI models can do this for every single product, TV show, website and internet user. This is how the modern ad-tech industry works. Real-time bidding markets price the display ads that appear alongside the websites you visit, and advertisers use <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/iccl-report-on-the-scale-of-real-time-bidding-data-broadcasts-in-the-u-s-and-europe/">AI models</a> to decide when they want to pay that price&#8212;<a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/iccl-report-on-the-scale-of-real-time-bidding-data-broadcasts-in-the-u-s-and-europe/">thousands of times per second</a>.</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>Next, scope. AI can be advantageous when it does more things than any one person could, even when a human might do better at any one of those tasks. Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT can engage in conversation on any topic, write an essay espousing any position, create poetry in any style and language, write computer code in any programming language, and more. These models may not be superior to skilled humans at any one of these things, but no single human could outperform top-tier generative models across them all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the combination of these competencies that generates value. Employers often struggle to find people with talents in disciplines such as software development and data science who also have strong prior knowledge of the employer&#8217;s domain. Organizations are likely to continue to rely on human specialists to write the best code and the best persuasive text, but they will increasingly be satisfied with AI when they just need a passable version of either.</p>
<h3>Sophistication</h3>
<p>Finally, sophistication. AIs can consider more factors in their decisions than humans can, and this can endow them with superhuman performance on specialized tasks. Computers have long been used to keep track of a multiplicity of factors that compound and interact in ways more complex than a human could trace. The 1990s chess-playing computer systems such as Deep Blue succeeded by thinking a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/224538.224567">dozen or more moves</a> ahead.</p>
<p>Modern AI systems use a radically different approach: Deep learning systems built from many-layered <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414">neural networks</a> take account of complex interactions&#8212;often many billions&#8212;among many factors. Neural networks now power the best chess-playing models and most other AI systems.</p>
<p>Chess is not the only domain where eschewing conventional rules and formal logic in favor of highly sophisticated and inscrutable systems has generated progress. The stunning advance of <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/a-high-level-overview/">AlphaFold2</a>, the AI model of structural biology whose creators Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were recognized with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/machine-learning-cracked-the-protein-folding-problem-and-won-the-2024-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-240937">Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2024</a>, is another example.</p>
<p>This breakthrough replaced traditional physics-based systems for predicting how sequences of amino acids would fold into three-dimensional shapes with a 93 million-parameter model, even though it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab881">doesn&#8217;t account for physical laws</a>. That lack of real-world grounding is not desirable: No one likes the enigmatic nature of these AI systems, and scientists are eager to understand better how they work.</p>
<p>But the sophistication of AI is providing value to scientists, and its <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02980-0">use across scientific fields</a> has grown exponentially in recent years.</p>
<h3>Context matters</h3>
<p>Those are the four dimensions where AI can excel over humans. Accuracy still matters. You wouldn&#8217;t want to use an AI that makes graphics look glitchy or targets ads randomly&#8212;yet accuracy isn&#8217;t the differentiator. The AI doesn&#8217;t need superhuman accuracy. It&#8217;s enough for AI to be merely good and fast, or adequate and scalable. Increasing scope often comes with an accuracy penalty, because AI can generalize poorly to truly novel tasks. The 4 S&#8217;s are sometimes at odds. With a given amount of computing power, you generally have to trade off scale for sophistication.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, when an AI takes over a human task, the task can change. Sometimes the AI is just doing things differently. Other times, AI starts doing different things. These changes bring new opportunities and new risks.</p>
<p>For example, high-frequency trading isn&#8217;t just computers trading stocks faster; it&#8217;s a fundamentally different kind of trading <a href="https://www.oxjournal.org/assessing-the-impact-of-high-frequency-trading-on-market-efficiency-and-stability/">that enables</a> entirely new strategies, tactics and associated risks. Likewise, AI has developed more <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/innovations-of-alphago/">sophisticated strategies</a> for the games of chess and Go. And the scale of AI chatbots has changed the nature of propaganda by allowing artificial voices to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/future-politics-bots-drowning-out-humans/604489/">overwhelm human speech</a>.</p>
<p>It is this &#8220;phase shift,&#8221; when changes in degree may transform into changes in kind, where AI&#8217;s impacts to society are likely to be most keenly felt. All of this points to the places that AI can have a positive impact. When a system has a bottleneck related to speed, scale, scope or sophistication, or when one of these factors poses a real barrier to being able to accomplish a goal, it makes sense to think about how AI could help.</p>
<p>Equally, when speed, scale, scope and sophistication are not primary barriers, it makes less sense to use AI. This is why AI auto-suggest features for short communications such as text messages can feel so annoying. They offer little speed advantage and no benefit from sophistication, while sacrificing the sincerity of human communication.</p>
<p>Many deployments of customer service chatbots also fail this test, which may explain <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-09-gartner-survey-finds-64-percent-of-customers-would-prefer-that-companies-didnt-use-ai-for-customer-service">their unpopularity</a>. Companies invest in them because of their scalability, and yet the bots often become a barrier to support rather than a speedy or sophisticated problem solver.</p>
<h3>Where the advantage lies</h3>
<p>Keep this in mind when you encounter a new application for AI or consider AI as a replacement for or an augmentation to a human process. Looking for bottlenecks in speed, scale, scope and sophistication provides a framework for understanding where AI provides value, and equally where the unique capabilities of the human species give us an enduring advantage.</p>
