                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, acting FAA <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Administrator Chris Rocheleau <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CIYNZJoosc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the House Appropriations Committee that the Federal Aviation Administration plans to replace its aging air traffic control systems, which</span> still rely on floppy disks and Windows 95 computers, Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/the-faa-seeks-to-eliminate-floppy-disk-usage-in-air-traffic-control-systems">reports</a>. The agency has issued a Request For Information to gather proposals from companies willing to tackle the massive infrastructure overhaul.</p>
<p>"The whole idea is to replace the system. No more floppy disks or paper strips," Rocheleau said during the committee hearing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the project "the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades," describing it as a bipartisan priority.</p>
<p>Most air traffic control towers and facilities across the US currently operate with technology that seems frozen in the 20th century, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing—when it works. Some controllers currently use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_progress_strip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper strips</a> to track aircraft movements and transfer data between systems using floppy disks, while their computers run Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-95-turns-20-and-ars-reminisces-on-a-simpler-age-long-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 95</a> operating system, which launched in 1995.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/faa-to-retire-floppy-disks-and-windows-95-amid-air-traffic-control-overhaul/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-gov-models-for-u-s-national-security-customers">unveiled</a> specialized AI models designed for US national security customers. The company released "Claude Gov" models that were built in response to direct feedback from government clients to handle operations such as strategic planning, intelligence analysis, and operational support. The custom models reportedly already serve US national security agencies, with access restricted to those working in classified environments.</p>
<p>The Claude Gov models differ from Anthropic's consumer and enterprise offerings, also called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, in several ways. They reportedly handle classified material, "refuse less" when engaging with classified information, and are customized to handle intelligence and defense documents. The models also feature what Anthropic calls "enhanced proficiency" in languages and dialects critical to national security operations.</p>
<p>Anthropic says the new models underwent the same "safety testing" as all Claude models. The company has been pursuing government contracts as it seeks reliable revenue sources, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/safe-ai-champ-anthropic-teams-up-with-defense-giant-palantir-in-new-deal/">partnering with Palantir</a> and Amazon Web Services in November to sell AI tools to defense customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-releases-custom-ai-chatbot-for-classified-spy-work/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Millions of low-cost devices for media streaming, in-vehicle entertainment, and video projection are infected with malware that turns consumer networks into platforms for distributing malware, concealing nefarious communications, and performing other illicit activities, the FBI has warned.</p>
<p>The malware infecting these devices, known as BadBox, is based on Triada, a malware strain <a href="https://securelist.com/everyone-sees-not-what-they-want-to-see/74997/">discovered</a> in 2016 by Kaspersky Lab, which called it "one of the most advanced mobile Trojans" the security firm's analysts had ever encountered. It employed an impressive kit of tools, including rooting exploits that bypassed security protections built into Android and functions for modifying the Android OS's all-powerful Zygote process. Google eventually updated Android to block the methods Triada used to infect devices.</p>
<h2>The threat remains</h2>
<p>A year later, Triada returned, only this time, devices came pre-infected before they reached consumers’ hands. In 2019, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/google-confirms-2017-supply-chain-attack-that-sneaked-backdoor-on-android-devices/">confirmed</a> that the supply-chain attack affected thousands of devices and that the company had once again taken measures to thwart it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/millions-of-low-cost-android-devices-turn-home-networks-into-crime-platforms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/opinion/anthropic-ceo-regulate-transparency.html">argued against</a> a proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation in a New York Times opinion piece, calling the measure shortsighted and overbroad as Congress considers including it in President Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">tax policy bill</a>. Anthropic makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Amodei warned that AI is advancing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">too fast</a> for such a long freeze, predicting these systems "could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">we covered</a> in May, the moratorium would prevent states from regulating AI for a decade. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ai-regulation-ban-meets-opposition-state-attorneys-general-over-risks-us-2025-05-16/">opposed the measure</a>, which would preempt AI laws and regulations recently passed in dozens of states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-10-years-all-bets-are-off-anthropic-ceo-opposes-decade-long-freeze-on-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google says its Chrome browser will stop trusting certificates from two certificate authorities after “patterns of concerning behavior observed over the past year” diminished trust in their reliability.</p>
<p>The two organizations, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Telecom and Budapest-based Netlock, are among the dozens of certificate authorities trusted by Chrome and most other browsers to provide digital certificates that encrypt traffic and certify the authenticity of sites. With the ability to mint cryptographic credentials that cause address bars to display a padlock, assuring the trustworthiness of a site, these certificate authorities wield significant control over the security of the web.</p>
<h2>Inherent risk</h2>
<p>“Over the past several months and years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports,” members of the Chrome security team <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/sustaining-digital-certificate-security-chrome-root-store-changes.html">wrote Tuesday</a>. “When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the internet, continued public trust is no longer justified.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/chrome-boots-2-certificate-authorities-citing-a-lack-of-trust-and-confidence/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>
<p>The covert tracking—implemented in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href="https://ads.yandex/metrica">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href="https://source.Android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a></span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning"> partitioning</a> and <a href="https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/storage-partitioning">storage partitioning</a>, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site.</p>
<h2>A blatant violation</h2>
<p>“One of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,” Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. “You run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has cut the lowest tier in its VMware partner program. The move allows the enterprise technology firm to continue its focus on customers with larger VMware deployments, but it also risks more migrations from VMware users and partners.</p>
<h2>Broadcom ousts low-tier VMware partners</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.broadcom.com/partners/fueling-customer-success-through-deep-partner-collaboration">blog post</a> on Sunday, Broadcom executive Brian Moats announced that the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Resellers, which became the VMware partner program after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">Broadcom eliminated the original one</a> in January 2024, would now offer three tiers instead of four. Broadcom is killing the Registered tier, leaving the Pinnacle, Premier, and Select tiers.</p>
<p>The reduction is a result of Broadcom's "strategic direction" and a "comprehensive partner review" and affects VMware's Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan geographies, Moats wrote. Affected partners are receiving 60 days' notice, Laura Falko, Broadcom’s head of global partner programs, marketing, and experience, told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/01/vmware_channel_changes/">The Register</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/broadcom-ends-business-with-vmwares-lowest-tier-channel-partners/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, members of the Russian cybercrime cartel <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">Trickbot</a> unleashed a relentless hacking spree on the world. The group attacked thousands of victims, including businesses, schools, and hospitals. “Fuck clinics in the usa this week,” one member wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">internal Trickbot messages</a> in 2020 about a list of 428 hospitals to target. Orchestrated by an enigmatic leader using the online moniker “Stern,” the group of around 100 cybercriminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of roughly six years.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyber-command-hackers-trickbot-botnet-precedent/">law enforcement</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-trickbot-ransomware-sanctions-uk-us/">disruptions</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/costa-rica-ransomware-conti/">damaging</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-leaks-ransomware-work-life/">leak of more than 60,000 internal chat messages</a> from Trickbot and the closely associated counterpart group Conti, the identity of Stern has remained a mystery. Last week, though, Germany’s federal police agency, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA, and local prosecutors <a href="https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/BekanntePersonen/Endgame_2/KVN/Sachverhalt.html">alleged that Stern’s real-world name is Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev</a>, a 36-year-old, 5-foot-11-inch Russian man who cops believe is in his home country and thus shielded from potential extradition.</p>
<p>A recently issued Interpol <a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices#2025-39252">red notice</a> says that Kovalev is wanted by Germany for allegedly being the “ringleader” of a “criminal organisation.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/german-police-say-theyve-identified-trickbot-ransomware-kingpin/">Read full article</a></p>

The model, which generates videos at 720p resolution (based on text descriptions called "prompts" or still image inputs), represents what may be the most capable consumer video generator to date, bringing video synthesis close to a point where it is becoming very difficult to distinguish between "authentic" and AI-generated media.</p>
<p>Google also <a href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow">launched Flow</a>, an online AI filmmaking tool that combines Veo 3 with the company's Imagen 4 image generator and Gemini language model, allowing creators to describe scenes in natural language and manage characters, locations, and visual styles in a web interface.</p>

<p>Both tools are now available to US subscribers of Google AI Ultra, a plan that costs $250 a month and comes with 12,500 credits. Veo 3 videos cost 150 credits per generation, allowing 83 videos on that plan before you run out. Extra credits are available for the price of 1 cent per credit in blocks of $25, $50, or $200. That comes out to about $1.50 per video generation. But is the price worth it? We ran some tests with various prompts to see what this technology is truly capable of.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of home and small office routers manufactured by Asus are being infected with a stealthy backdoor that can survive reboots and firmware updates in an attack by a nation-state or another well-resourced threat actor, researchers said.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers gain access to the devices by exploiting now-patched vulnerabilities, some of which have never been tracked through the internationally recognized CVE system. After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.</p>
<h2>Durable control</h2>
<p>“‍The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices,” researchers from security firm GreyNoise <a href="https://www.greynoise.io/blog/stealthy-backdoor-campaign-affecting-asus-routers">reported Wednesday</a>. “The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/thousands-of-asus-routers-are-being-hit-with-stealthy-persistent-backdoors/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A big part of this site's pitch to its clients, including the "hyperscale" customers with gigantic data centers nearby, is that each device is labeled, tracked, and inventoried for its drives—both obvious and hidden—and is either securely wiped or destroyed. The process, commonly called ITAD (for "IT Asset Disposition") is used by larger businesses, especially when they upgrade fleets of servers or workers' devices. ITAD providers ensure all the old gear is wiped clean, then resold, repurposed, recycled, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/where-hyperscale-hardware-goes-to-retire-ars-visits-a-very-big-itad-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The hacker ecosystem in Russia, more than perhaps anywhere else in the world, has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/russian-hacker-spy-botnet/">long blurred the lines</a> between cybercrime, state-sponsored cyberwarfare, and espionage. Now an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">indictment</a> of a group of Russian nationals and the takedown of their sprawling botnet offers the clearest example in years of how a single malware operation allegedly enabled hacking operations as varied as ransomware, wartime cyberattacks in Ukraine, and spying against foreign governments.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice today announced criminal charges today against 16 individuals law enforcement authorities have linked to a malware operation known as DanaBot, which according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">complaint</a> infected at least 300,000 machines around the world. The DOJ’s announcement of the charges describes the group as “Russia-based,” and names two of the suspects, Aleksandr Stepanov and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, as living in Novosibirsk, Russia. Five other suspects are named in the indictment, while another nine are identified only by their pseudonyms. In addition to those charges, the Justice Department says the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS)—a criminal investigation arm of the Department of Defense—carried out seizures of DanaBot infrastructure around the world, including in the US.</p>
<p>Aside from alleging how DanaBot was used in for-profit criminal hacking, the indictment also makes a rarer claim—it describes how a second variant of the malware it says was used in espionage against military, government, and NGO targets. “Pervasive malware like DanaBot harms hundreds of thousands of victims around the world, including sensitive military, diplomatic, and government entities, and causes many millions of dollars in losses,” US attorney Bill Essayli wrote in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/feds-charge-16-russians-allegedly-tied-to-botnets-used-in-cyberattacks-and-spying/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Marketers promote AI-assisted developer tools as workhorses that are essential for today’s software engineer. Developer platform GitLab, for instance, claims its Duo chatbot can “instantly generate a to-do list” that eliminates the burden of “wading through weeks of commits.” What these companies don’t say is that these tools are, by temperament if not default, easily tricked by malicious actors into performing hostile actions against their users.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Legit on Thursday <a href="https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/remote-prompt-injection-in-gitlab-duo">demonstrated</a> an attack that induced Duo into inserting malicious code into a script it had been instructed to write. The attack could also leak private code and confidential issue data, such as zero-day vulnerability details. All that’s required is for the user to instruct the chatbot to interact with a merge request or similar content from an outside source.</p>
<h2>AI assistants’ double-edged blade</h2>
<p>The mechanism for triggering the attacks is, of course, prompt injections. Among the most common forms of chatbot exploits, prompt injections are embedded into content a chatbot is asked to work with, such as an email to be answered, a calendar to consult, or a webpage to summarize. Large language model-based assistants are so eager to follow instructions that they’ll take orders from just about anywhere, including sources that can be controlled by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/researchers-cause-gitlab-ai-developer-assistant-to-turn-safe-code-malicious/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/#veo-3">launched Veo 3</a>, a new AI video synthesis model that can do something no major AI video generator has been able to do before: create a synchronized audio track. While from 2022 to 2024, we saw early steps in AI video generation, each video was silent and usually very short in duration. Now you can hear voices, dialog, and sound effects in eight-second high-definition video clips.</p>
<p>Shortly after the new launch, people began asking the most obvious benchmarking question: How good is Veo 3 at faking Oscar-winning actor Will Smith at eating spaghetti?</p>
<p>First, a brief recap. The spaghetti benchmark in AI video traces its origins back to March 2023, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/yes-virginia-there-is-ai-joy-in-seeing-fake-will-smith-ravenously-eat-spaghetti/">we first covered</a> an early example of horrific AI-generated video using an open source video synthesis model called ModelScope. The spaghetti example later became well-known enough that Smith <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">parodied it</a> almost a year later in February 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/googles-will-smith-double-is-better-at-eating-ai-spaghetti-but-its-crunchy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have found malicious software that received more than 6,000 downloads from the NPM repository over a two-year span, in yet another discovery showing the hidden threats users of such open source archives face.</p>
<p>Eight packages using names that closely mimicked those of widely used legitimate packages contained destructive payloads designed to corrupt or delete important data and crash systems, Kush Pandya, a researcher at security firm Socket, <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-npm-packages-target-react-vue-and-vite-ecosystems-with-destructive-payloads">reported Thursday</a>. The packages have been available for download for more than two years and accrued roughly 6,200 downloads over that time.</p>
<h2>A diversity of attack vectors</h2>
<p>“What makes this campaign particularly concerning is the diversity of attack vectors—from subtle data corruption to aggressive system shutdowns and file deletion,” Pandya wrote. “The packages were designed to target different parts of the JavaScript ecosystem with varied tactics.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/destructive-malware-available-in-npm-repo-went-unnoticed-for-2-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>VMware's business model under Broadcom is "legally and ethically flawed," a group of cloud service provider (CSP) customers and partners alleged in a report released today.</p>
<p>The report (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2nd-ECCO-Broadcom-Report.pdf">PDF</a>) comes from the European Cloud Competition Observatory (ECCO), which describes itself as "independent monitoring body" composed of members of the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade association, "with the support—acting as observers—of European customer organizations." ECCO says its goals include "highlighting ongoing or new unfair software licensing practices from any software vendors in the cloud sector," and it has previously written similar reports about Broadcom and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In its announcement of the report, ECCO said that CISPE members have met with Broadcom once about the changes it has made to VMware's business model, which is now built around subscriptions of bundled products, but didn't see any changes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/vmware-cloud-partners-demand-firm-regulatory-action-on-broadcom/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, marking the company's return to larger model releases after primarily focusing on mid-range Sonnet variants <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">since June</a> of last year. The new models represent what the company calls its most capable coding models yet, with Opus 4 designed for complex, long-running tasks that can operate autonomously for hours.</p>
<p>Alex Albert, Anthropic's head of Claude Relations, told Ars Technica that the company chose to revive the Opus line because of growing demand for agentic AI applications. "Across all the companies out there that are building things, there's a really large wave of these agentic applications springing up, and a very high demand and premium being placed on intelligence," Albert said. "I think Opus is going to fit that groove perfectly."</p>
<p>Before we go further, a brief refresher on Claude's three AI model "size" names (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">introduced</a> in March 2024) is probably warranted. Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus offer a tradeoff between price (in the API), speed, and capability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-in-text-callout">A consortium of</span> global law enforcement agencies and tech companies announced on Wednesday that they have disrupted the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/infostealer-malware-password-theft/">infostealer malware</a> known as Lumma. One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls “cyber threat actors” to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things.</p>
<p class="paywall">Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-digital-crime-unit-2023/">Digital Crimes Unit</a> (DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma’s infrastructure. At the same time, the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s command and control infrastructure and disrupted cybercriminal marketplaces that sold the Lumma malware. All of this was coordinated, too, with the disruption of regional Lumma infrastructure by Europol’s European Cybercrime Center and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center.</p>
<p>Microsoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is “easy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a “go-to tool,” including for the notorious <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cybersecurity-industry-fbi-ransomware/">Scattered Spider</a> cybercriminal gang. Attackers distribute the malware using targeted phishing attacks that typically impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/authorities-carry-out-global-takedown-of-infostealer-used-by-cybercriminals/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Signal Messenger is warning the users of its Windows Desktop version that the privacy of their messages is under threat by Recall, the AI tool rolling out in Windows 11 that will screenshot, index, and store almost everything a user does every three seconds.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, Signal for Windows will by default block the ability of Windows to screenshot the app. Signal users who want to disable the block—for instance to preserve a conversation for their records or make use of accessibility features for sight-impaired users—will have to change settings inside their desktop version to enable screenshots.</p>
<h2>My kingdom for an API</h2>
<p>“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk,” Signal officials <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-doesnt-recall/">wrote Wednesday</a>. “As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/signal-resorts-to-weird-trick-to-block-windows-recall-in-desktop-app/">Read full article</a></p>
