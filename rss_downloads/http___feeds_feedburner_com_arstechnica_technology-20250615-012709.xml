                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of passkeys, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn't susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords.</p>
<p>The import/export feature, which Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/279/?time=1152">demonstrated</a> at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.</p>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>That limitation has led to criticisms that passkeys are a power play by large companies to lock users into specific product ecosystems. Users have also rightly worried that the lack of transferability increases the risk of getting locked out of important accounts if a device storing passkeys is lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/apple-previews-new-import-export-feature-to-make-passkeys-more-interoperable/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Disney and <span data-schema="smart-brevity">NBCUniversal</span> filed a lawsuit against AI image-synthesis company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/midjourney-introduces-first-new-image-generation-model-in-over-a-year/">Midjourney</a>, accusing the company of copyright infringement for allowing users to create images of characters like Darth Vader and Shrek, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-universal-midjourney-1236262563/">reports</a> The Hollywood Reporter. The complaint, filed in US District Court in Los Angeles, marks the first major legal action by Hollywood studios against a generative AI company.</p>
<p>Midjourney is a subscription image-synthesis service and community that allows its users to submit written descriptions called prompts to an AI model that generates new images based on them. It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">well-known for years</a> that AI image-synthesis models such as the ones that power Midjourney have been trained on copyrighted artworks without rights holder permission.</p>
<p>The lawsuit describes San Francisco-based Midjourney as a "bottomless pit of plagiarism" that enables users to generate what the studios call "AI slop"—personalized images of copyrighted characters. Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions, and DreamWorks Animation joined forces in the legal filing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-landmark-suit-disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-for-ai-character-theft/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">announced</a> that o3-pro, a new version of its most capable simulated reasoning model, is now available to ChatGPT Pro and Team users, replacing o1-pro in the model picker. The company also reduced API pricing for o3-pro by 87 percent compared to o1-pro while cutting o3 prices by 80 percent. While "reasoning" is useful for some analytical tasks, new studies have posed fundamental questions about what the word actually means when applied to these AI systems.</p>
<p>We'll take a deeper look at "reasoning" in a minute, but first, let's examine what's new. While OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">originally launched</a> o3 (non-pro) in April, the o3-pro model focuses on mathematics, science, and coding while adding new capabilities like web search, file analysis, image analysis, and Python execution. Since these tool integrations slow response times (longer than the already slow o1-pro), OpenAI recommends using the model for complex problems where accuracy matters more than speed. However, they do not necessarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/">confabulate less</a> than "non-reasoning" AI models (they still introduce factual errors), which is a significant caveat when seeking accurate results.</p>
<p>Beyond the reported performance improvements, OpenAI announced a substantial price reduction for developers. O3-pro costs $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API, making it 87 percent cheaper than o1-pro. The company also reduced the price of the standard o3 model by 80 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have unearthed two publicly available exploits that completely evade protections offered by Secure Boot, the industry-wide mechanism for ensuring devices load only secure operating system images during the boot-up process. Microsoft is taking action to block one exploit and allowing the other one to remain a viable threat.</p>
<p>As part of Tuesday's monthly security update routine, Microsoft <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-3052">patched</a> CVE-2025-3052, a Secure Boot bypass vulnerability affecting more than 50 device makers. More than a dozen modules that allow devices from these manufacturers to run on Linux allow an attacker with physical access to turn off Secure Boot and, from there, go on to install malware that runs before the operating system loads. Such “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">evil maid</a>” attacks are precisely the threat Secure Boot is designed to prevent. The vulnerability can also be exploited remotely to make infections stealthier and more powerful if an attacker has already gained administrative control of a machine.</p>
<h2>A single point of failure</h2>
<p>The underlying cause of the vulnerability is a critical vulnerability in a tool used to flash firmware images on the motherboards of devices sold by DT Research, a manufacturer of rugged mobile devices. It has <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a11996aaf7f32aa09f78db608106e25a47970bfeeec76d49af743eee71b55f06/">been available</a> on VirusTotal since last year and was digitally signed in 2022, an indication it has been available through other channels since at least that earlier date.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/unearthed-in-the-wild-2-secure-boot-exploits-microsoft-patches-only-1-of-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has struck a deal to use Google's cloud computing infrastructure for AI despite the two companies' fierce competition in the space, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/">reports</a> Reuters. The agreement, finalized in May after months of negotiations, marks a shift in OpenAI's strategy to diversify its computing resources beyond Microsoft Azure, which had been its exclusive cloud provider until January.</p>
<p>Microsoft's long-standing partnership with OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">dates back to 2019</a>, with significant expansions of investment from the computer giant in 2021 and 2023. In October, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-eases-away-from-microsoft-data-centers">reported</a> that the ChatGPT maker had begun to seek data center deals elsewhere, citing the need for more AI data center servers faster than Microsoft could supply them.</p>
<p>Under the new deal, Google Cloud will provide additional computing capacity to help OpenAI train and run its AI models. For OpenAI, the partnership addresses growing demands for computing power as the company's annual revenue <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openais-annualized-revenue-hits-10-billion-up-55-billion-december-2024-2025-06-09/">reached $10 billion</a> as of June, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/openai-signs-surprise-deal-with-google-cloud-despite-fierce-ai-rivalry/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta has developed plans to create a new artificial intelligence research lab dedicated to pursuing "superintelligence," according to reporting from The New York Times. The social media giant chose 28-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandr_Wang">Alexandr Wang</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI">Scale AI</a>, to join the new lab as part of a broader reorganization of Meta's AI efforts under CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Superintelligence refers to a hypothetical AI system that would exceed human cognitive abilities—a step beyond artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to match an intelligent human's capability for learning new tasks without intensive specialized training.</p>
<p>However, much like AGI, superintelligence remains a nebulous term in the field. Since scientists still poorly understand the mechanics of human intelligence, and because human intelligence resists simple quantification with no single definition, identifying superintelligence when it arrives will present significant challenges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/">Read full article</a></p>

The agency has issued a Request For Information to gather proposals from companies willing to tackle the massive infrastructure overhaul.</p>
<p>"The whole idea is to replace the system. No more floppy disks or paper strips," Rocheleau said during the committee hearing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the project "the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades," describing it as a bipartisan priority.</p>
<p>Most air traffic control towers and facilities across the US currently operate with technology that seems frozen in the 20th century, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing—when it works. Some controllers currently use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_progress_strip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper strips</a> to track aircraft movements and transfer data between systems using floppy disks, while their computers run Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-95-turns-20-and-ars-reminisces-on-a-simpler-age-long-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 95</a> operating system, which launched in 1995.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/faa-to-retire-floppy-disks-and-windows-95-amid-air-traffic-control-overhaul/">Read full article</a></p>

The company released "Claude Gov" models that were built in response to direct feedback from government clients to handle operations such as strategic planning, intelligence analysis, and operational support. The custom models reportedly already serve US national security agencies, with access restricted to those working in classified environments.</p>
<p>The Claude Gov models differ from Anthropic's consumer and enterprise offerings, also called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, in several ways. They reportedly handle classified material, "refuse less" when engaging with classified information, and are customized to handle intelligence and defense documents. The models also feature what Anthropic calls "enhanced proficiency" in languages and dialects critical to national security operations.</p>
<p>Anthropic says the new models underwent the same "safety testing" as all Claude models. The company has been pursuing government contracts as it seeks reliable revenue sources, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/safe-ai-champ-anthropic-teams-up-with-defense-giant-palantir-in-new-deal/">partnering with Palantir</a> and Amazon Web Services in November to sell AI tools to defense customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-releases-custom-ai-chatbot-for-classified-spy-work/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The malware infecting these devices, known as BadBox, is based on Triada, a malware strain <a href="https://securelist.com/everyone-sees-not-what-they-want-to-see/74997/">discovered</a> in 2016 by Kaspersky Lab, which called it "one of the most advanced mobile Trojans" the security firm's analysts had ever encountered. It employed an impressive kit of tools, including rooting exploits that bypassed security protections built into Android and functions for modifying the Android OS's all-powerful Zygote process. Google eventually updated Android to block the methods Triada used to infect devices.</p>
<h2>The threat remains</h2>
<p>A year later, Triada returned, only this time, devices came pre-infected before they reached consumers’ hands. In 2019, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/google-confirms-2017-supply-chain-attack-that-sneaked-backdoor-on-android-devices/">confirmed</a> that the supply-chain attack affected thousands of devices and that the company had once again taken measures to thwart it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/millions-of-low-cost-android-devices-turn-home-networks-into-crime-platforms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/opinion/anthropic-ceo-regulate-transparency.html">argued against</a> a proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation in a New York Times opinion piece, calling the measure shortsighted and overbroad as Congress considers including it in President Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">tax policy bill</a>. Anthropic makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Amodei warned that AI is advancing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">too fast</a> for such a long freeze, predicting these systems "could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">we covered</a> in May, the moratorium would prevent states from regulating AI for a decade. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ai-regulation-ban-meets-opposition-state-attorneys-general-over-risks-us-2025-05-16/">opposed the measure</a>, which would preempt AI laws and regulations recently passed in dozens of states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-10-years-all-bets-are-off-anthropic-ceo-opposes-decade-long-freeze-on-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google says its Chrome browser will stop trusting certificates from two certificate authorities after “patterns of concerning behavior observed over the past year” diminished trust in their reliability.</p>
<p>The two organizations, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Telecom and Budapest-based Netlock, are among the dozens of certificate authorities trusted by Chrome and most other browsers to provide digital certificates that encrypt traffic and certify the authenticity of sites. With the ability to mint cryptographic credentials that cause address bars to display a padlock, assuring the trustworthiness of a site, these certificate authorities wield significant control over the security of the web.</p>
<h2>Inherent risk</h2>
<p>“Over the past several months and years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports,” members of the Chrome security team <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/sustaining-digital-certificate-security-chrome-root-store-changes.html">wrote Tuesday</a>. “When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the internet, continued public trust is no longer justified.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/chrome-boots-2-certificate-authorities-citing-a-lack-of-trust-and-confidence/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>
<p>The covert tracking—implemented in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href="https://ads.yandex/metrica">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href="https://source.Android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a></span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning"> partitioning</a> and <a href="https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/storage-partitioning">storage partitioning</a>, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site.</p>
<h2>A blatant violation</h2>
<p>“One of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,” Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. “You run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has cut the lowest tier in its VMware partner program. The move allows the enterprise technology firm to continue its focus on customers with larger VMware deployments, but it also risks more migrations from VMware users and partners.</p>
<h2>Broadcom ousts low-tier VMware partners</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.broadcom.com/partners/fueling-customer-success-through-deep-partner-collaboration">blog post</a> on Sunday, Broadcom executive Brian Moats announced that the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Resellers, which became the VMware partner program after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">Broadcom eliminated the original one</a> in January 2024, would now offer three tiers instead of four. Broadcom is killing the Registered tier, leaving the Pinnacle, Premier, and Select tiers.</p>
<p>The reduction is a result of Broadcom's "strategic direction" and a "comprehensive partner review" and affects VMware's Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan geographies, Moats wrote. Affected partners are receiving 60 days' notice, Laura Falko, Broadcom’s head of global partner programs, marketing, and experience, told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/01/vmware_channel_changes/">The Register</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/broadcom-ends-business-with-vmwares-lowest-tier-channel-partners/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, members of the Russian cybercrime cartel <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">Trickbot</a> unleashed a relentless hacking spree on the world. The group attacked thousands of victims, including businesses, schools, and hospitals. “Fuck clinics in the usa this week,” one member wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">internal Trickbot messages</a> in 2020 about a list of 428 hospitals to target. Orchestrated by an enigmatic leader using the online moniker “Stern,” the group of around 100 cybercriminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of roughly six years.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyber-command-hackers-trickbot-botnet-precedent/">law enforcement</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-trickbot-ransomware-sanctions-uk-us/">disruptions</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/costa-rica-ransomware-conti/">damaging</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-leaks-ransomware-work-life/">leak of more than 60,000 internal chat messages</a> from Trickbot and the closely associated counterpart group Conti, the identity of Stern has remained a mystery. Last week, though, Germany’s federal police agency, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA, and local prosecutors <a href="https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/BekanntePersonen/Endgame_2/KVN/Sachverhalt.html">alleged that Stern’s real-world name is Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev</a>, a 36-year-old, 5-foot-11-inch Russian man who cops believe is in his home country and thus shielded from potential extradition.</p>
<p>A recently issued Interpol <a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices#2025-39252">red notice</a> says that Kovalev is wanted by Germany for allegedly being the “ringleader” of a “criminal organisation.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/german-police-say-theyve-identified-trickbot-ransomware-kingpin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/#veo-3">introduced Veo 3</a>, its newest video generation model that can create 8-second clips with synchronized sound effects and audio dialog—a first for the company's AI tools. The model, which generates videos at 720p resolution (based on text descriptions called "prompts" or still image inputs), represents what may be the most capable consumer video generator to date, bringing video synthesis close to a point where it is becoming very difficult to distinguish between "authentic" and AI-generated media.</p>
<p>Google also <a href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow">launched Flow</a>, an online AI filmmaking tool that combines Veo 3 with the company's Imagen 4 image generator and Gemini language model, allowing creators to describe scenes in natural language and manage characters, locations, and visual styles in a web interface.</p>

<p>Both tools are now available to US subscribers of Google AI Ultra, a plan that costs $250 a month and comes with 12,500 credits. Veo 3 videos cost 150 credits per generation, allowing 83 videos on that plan before you run out. Extra credits are available for the price of 1 cent per credit in blocks of $25, $50, or $200. That comes out to about $1.50 per video generation. But is the price worth it? We ran some tests with various prompts to see what this technology is truly capable of.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of home and small office routers manufactured by Asus are being infected with a stealthy backdoor that can survive reboots and firmware updates in an attack by a nation-state or another well-resourced threat actor, researchers said.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers gain access to the devices by exploiting now-patched vulnerabilities, some of which have never been tracked through the internationally recognized CVE system. After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.</p>
<h2>Durable control</h2>
<p>“‍The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices,” researchers from security firm GreyNoise <a href="https://www.greynoise.io/blog/stealthy-backdoor-campaign-affecting-asus-routers">reported Wednesday</a>. “The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/thousands-of-asus-routers-are-being-hit-with-stealthy-persistent-backdoors/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Eric Ingebretsen, chief commercial officer at <a href="https://www.sktes.com/">SK TES</a>, an IT asset disposition provider, tells me this early on during a tour of a 128,000-square-foot facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He will restate this a few times.</p>
<p>A big part of this site's pitch to its clients, including the "hyperscale" customers with gigantic data centers nearby, is that each device is labeled, tracked, and inventoried for its drives—both obvious and hidden—and is either securely wiped or destroyed. The process, commonly called ITAD (for "IT Asset Disposition") is used by larger businesses, especially when they upgrade fleets of servers or workers' devices. ITAD providers ensure all the old gear is wiped clean, then resold, repurposed, recycled, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/where-hyperscale-hardware-goes-to-retire-ars-visits-a-very-big-itad-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The hacker ecosystem in Russia, more than perhaps anywhere else in the world, has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/russian-hacker-spy-botnet/">long blurred the lines</a> between cybercrime, state-sponsored cyberwarfare, and espionage. Now an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">indictment</a> of a group of Russian nationals and the takedown of their sprawling botnet offers the clearest example in years of how a single malware operation allegedly enabled hacking operations as varied as ransomware, wartime cyberattacks in Ukraine, and spying against foreign governments.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice today announced criminal charges today against 16 individuals law enforcement authorities have linked to a malware operation known as DanaBot, which according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">complaint</a> infected at least 300,000 machines around the world. The DOJ’s announcement of the charges describes the group as “Russia-based,” and names two of the suspects, Aleksandr Stepanov and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, as living in Novosibirsk, Russia. Five other suspects are named in the indictment, while another nine are identified only by their pseudonyms. In addition to those charges, the Justice Department says the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS)—a criminal investigation arm of the Department of Defense—carried out seizures of DanaBot infrastructure around the world, including in the US.</p>
<p>Aside from alleging how DanaBot was used in for-profit criminal hacking, the indictment also makes a rarer claim—it describes how a second variant of the malware it says was used in espionage against military, government, and NGO targets. “Pervasive malware like DanaBot harms hundreds of thousands of victims around the world, including sensitive military, diplomatic, and government entities, and causes many millions of dollars in losses,” US attorney Bill Essayli wrote in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/feds-charge-16-russians-allegedly-tied-to-botnets-used-in-cyberattacks-and-spying/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Marketers promote AI-assisted developer tools as workhorses that are essential for today’s software engineer. Developer platform GitLab, for instance, claims its Duo chatbot can “instantly generate a to-do list” that eliminates the burden of “wading through weeks of commits.” What these companies don’t say is that these tools are, by temperament if not default, easily tricked by malicious actors into performing hostile actions against their users.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Legit on Thursday <a href="https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/remote-prompt-injection-in-gitlab-duo">demonstrated</a> an attack that induced Duo into inserting malicious code into a script it had been instructed to write. The attack could also leak private code and confidential issue data, such as zero-day vulnerability details. All that’s required is for the user to instruct the chatbot to interact with a merge request or similar content from an outside source.</p>
<h2>AI assistants’ double-edged blade</h2>
<p>The mechanism for triggering the attacks is, of course, prompt injections. Among the most common forms of chatbot exploits, prompt injections are embedded into content a chatbot is asked to work with, such as an email to be answered, a calendar to consult, or a webpage to summarize. Large language model-based assistants are so eager to follow instructions that they’ll take orders from just about anywhere, including sources that can be controlled by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/researchers-cause-gitlab-ai-developer-assistant-to-turn-safe-code-malicious/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/#veo-3">launched Veo 3</a>, a new AI video synthesis model that can do something no major AI video generator has been able to do before: create a synchronized audio track. While from 2022 to 2024, we saw early steps in AI video generation, each video was silent and usually very short in duration. Now you can hear voices, dialog, and sound effects in eight-second high-definition video clips.</p>
<p>Shortly after the new launch, people began asking the most obvious benchmarking question: How good is Veo 3 at faking Oscar-winning actor Will Smith at eating spaghetti?</p>
<p>First, a brief recap. The spaghetti benchmark in AI video traces its origins back to March 2023, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/yes-virginia-there-is-ai-joy-in-seeing-fake-will-smith-ravenously-eat-spaghetti/">we first covered</a> an early example of horrific AI-generated video using an open source video synthesis model called ModelScope. The spaghetti example later became well-known enough that Smith <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">parodied it</a> almost a year later in February 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/googles-will-smith-double-is-better-at-eating-ai-spaghetti-but-its-crunchy/">Read full article</a></p>
