<p>Reports like these give a brief window into the ways AI is being used by malicious actors around the world.

<p><i>The Atlantic</i> makes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/06/ukraine-new-war-drone-strike/683008/">similar points</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a balance between the cost of the thing, and the cost to destroy the thing, and that balance is changing dramatically. This isn&#8217;t new, of course. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/03/drones-and-the-us-air-force.html">Here&#8217;s</a> an article from last year about the cost of drones versus the cost of top-of-the-line fighter jets. If $35K in drones (117 drones times an estimated $300 per drone) can destroy $7B in Russian bombers and other long-range aircraft, why would anyone build more of those planes? And we can have this discussion about ships, or tanks, or pretty much every other military vehicle. And then we can add in drone-coordinating technologies like swarming.</p>
<p>Clearly we need more research on remotely and automatically <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/six-ways-to-disable-a-drone/">disabling</a> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/29/1117502/epirus-drone-zapping-microwave-us-military-defense/">drones</a>.</p>
