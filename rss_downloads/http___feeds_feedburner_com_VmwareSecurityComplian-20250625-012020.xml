<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern enterprise is rapidly adopting a private cloud strategy for its environments. A </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/docs/private-cloud-outlook-2025?_gl=1*15bvn7r*_ga*MTE0NDU3NTUwNS4xNzI2MjU5MjY4*_ga_8VJHMNGE3E*czE3NDk2NTc5OTIkbzIxMSRnMSR0MTc0OTY1ODA5MiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.#_gl=1*1auajbj*_gcl_ag*Mi4xLmswQUFBQUFEaTNTdlY0ZVpDTGg5cEZhRjhRM1J4aGRjb2NBJGkxNzQ5NDkzMDU2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent research study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involving 1,800 senior leaders revealed that their organizations are prioritizing private cloud to address challenges stemming from cost concerns, the need for predictability, AI workload requirements, lateral security, and compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With digital enterprises doubling down on private cloud strategies, IT and security teams face the challenge of securing workloads as quickly and efficiently as possible. With most ransomware breaches involving lateral propagation of threats to hunt for high-value assets, security strategies are evolving to protect both critical and non-critical workloads across all private cloud deployments. vDefend is a leading software-defined, hypervisor-integrated, lateral security solution purpose-built to comprehensively protect every VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) workload. vDefend brings robust, integrated network security controls directly into the VCF fabric. The solution enables micro-segmentation and threat defense to be rapidly adopted, managed, and scaled, ultimately accelerating an organization’s zero-trust implementation strategies. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to announce new vDefend innovations for VCF 9.0:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>VPC-Aware Lateral Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Users can now implement vDefend at the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) level, applying lateral security policies that are isolated and managed per tenant. This capability adds precise control and delegated administration to enable multi-tenant environments.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Self-Service Micro-segmentation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Infrastructure teams create centralized firewall policies for walled-garden zones for application deployments. With the new vDefend 9.0 release, application owners can be delegated to create fine-grained policies within these zones. Policies can be automated via APIs in DevOps CI/CD pipelines.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>VCF Import Integration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Existing vDefend deployments outside of VCF can be imported into the VCF 9.0 environment, preserving policies and reducing transition effort. This method simplifies and accelerates their migration to a full-stack VCF platform.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Global IPS/IDS Policy Management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Centralized management of intrusion prevention and detection policies across multiple sites ensures consistent enforcement and a faster response to threats, regardless of where workloads reside.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>IDS/IPS Signature Portal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Enables real-time research of IDS/IPS signature changes without requiring login to the vDefend console. This streamlines operations, enhances threat coverage awareness, and incident response across the organization. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Geo-IP Filtering: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">vDefend Gateway Firewall can now uniquely manage and secure traffic by allowing or blocking connections to a specific geographic location directly at the T0 gateway firewall, enabling precise control over global traffic flows.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">vDefend implementation with VCF 9.0 makes advanced security easier to adopt, tenant-aware, and centrally managed, turning security from a barrier into a built-in capability.</span></p>
<h3><b>VPC-Aware Lateral Security</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-tenancy is foundational for enterprises, but achieving complete isolation across both the data and control planes has been a persistent challenge. The introduction of VPCs brought significant improvements by enabling both data and control plane separation for networking and security, allowing for more granular application-level isolation, often managed by the DevOps team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 release, vDefend extends lateral security capabilities to deliver true per-VPC network isolation with microsegmentation, allowing only trusted application traffic. This enhancement enables delegated administration, ensuring that each VPC admin can only view and manage configurations within their own VPC. Teams can now work in parallel with full self-service and complete isolation, making secure multi-tenancy in private clouds a reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84373" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png?w=790" alt="" width="790" height="562" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png 790w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=600,427 600w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Self-Service Micro-segmentation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">vDefend Firewall empowers both infrastructure administrators and VPC owners. Infrastructure administrators can establish secure Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), minimizing east-west communication. Simultaneously, VPC owners gain the flexibility to configure detailed rules for their applications, ensuring functionality without compromising central security policies. This approach promotes security self-service for end-users while upholding the organization&#8217;s overall security posture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84374" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png?w=801" alt="" width="801" height="480" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png 801w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-2.png?resize=600,360 600w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Seamless Migration with VCF Import</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing vDefend deployments outside of VCF can be easily imported into the VCF 9.0 environment with their current vDefend Firewall policies intact, which reduces the overhead associated with transition. This streamlined migration process enables customers to transition to a full-stack VCF platform efficiently, reducing overhead and eliminating the need to start from scratch.</span></p>
<h3><b>Simplified, Centralized IDS/IPS Policy Management Across Multi-instance VCF with Air-Gap support </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large, multi-instance (federated) VCF environments require a consistent, organization-wide IDS/IPS security policy and signature management with efficient and easy operations. Customers can now deliver global IDS/IPS security policies across distributed VCF deployments with centralized policy management capabilities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84376" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png?w=995" alt="" width="995" height="539" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png 995w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png?resize=768,416 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png?resize=410,222 410w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/image-3_v2.png?resize=600,325 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, multiple IDS/IPS signature bundle assignments enable users to apply specific signature bundles where needed across their VCF deployments. For air-gapped environments, delivery of IDS/IPS signature bundles to Local Managers is supported even when internet connectivity and compliance restrictions are in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, these capabilities offer consistent, centralized threat prevention policy management across multi-instance VCF deployments. All IDS/IPS events are visible within a single management console.</span></p>
<h3><b>Real-Time Visibility With New IDS/IPS Signature Portal</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping security defenses current is non-negotiable; enterprises rely on frequent signature updates to stay ahead of emerging threats. While vDefend already makes it easy to download and review the latest IDS/IPS signature bundles through the vDefend console, security analysts often need deeper insight, such as identifying what’s new in each bundle, tracking version history, searching for coverage against specific CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), or looking for coverage against specific attack patterns such as Command and Control communications. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-84377 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png?w=832" alt="" width="832" height="586" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png 832w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png?resize=768,541 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/blog-image-4.png?resize=600,423 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new IDS/IPS Signature </span><a href="https://appd.securityti.vmware.com/#/app/ids-signatures/login"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’re introducing a powerful tool that allows operators to research signature updates in real time, without needing to log into the vDefend console. With easy web-based access, the portal lets teams research signatures, search for specific threat coverage, compare versions, and export signature lists. This capability not only streamlines initial planning and deployment but also facilitates easier collaboration and quicker action among teams, ultimately enhancing threat coverage awareness and incident response across the organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Precision Control of Traffic Flows with Country-based Geo-fencing of Traffic</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure administrators can now allow or block incoming and outgoing traffic based on specific geographic locations in vDefend Gateway Firewall. This new capability provides precise, targeted control of traffic, enhancing security posture and ensuring compliance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84382" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png?w=798" alt="" width="798" height="496" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png 798w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png?resize=768,477 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Blog-image-5_v2.png?resize=600,373 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px" /></a></p>

It not only highlights segmentation gaps but also provides actionable recommendations to harden your environment against modern threats.</p>
<p>This capability is available with both VMware vDefend Firewall and VMware vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention license SKUs.</p>
<h2>USE CASE</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional perimeter firewalls are no longer sufficient to defend against sophisticated threats, such as ransomware. Once inside the network, attackers often exploit open ports and insecure protocols to move laterally—unchecked by perimeter controls that lack visibility into East-West traffic, which now constitutes over </span><b>90% of datacenter communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern applications are distributed, dynamic, and multi-tiered—making them difficult to protect using legacy approaches. </span><b>Security Segmentation Assessment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerates the deployment of the </span><b>vDefend Distributed Firewall (DFW)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by identifying where segmentation is missing and where risks remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It delivers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>Segmentation Score</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on observed flows and firewall configurations, offering a clear snapshot of how well your infrastructure and applications are protected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>Segmentation Report</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that surfaces high-risk workloads, communication chains, and potential blast radii.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tailored guidance for implementing DFW to close gaps, enforce least privilege, and move toward a </span><b>zero-trust security model</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When used in conjunction with </span><b>Security Intelligence recommendations and auto-publishing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, organizations can fast-track their journey to effective micro-segmentation.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84349" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png?w=989" alt="" width="989" height="341" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png 989w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png?resize=768,265 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/06/Sec_segment_assess_blog_eb7135.png?resize=600,207 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>SOLUTION</b></h2>
<p><b>Micro-segmentation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a phased journey—culminating in a security model where all unidentified traffic is dropped by default. Reaching this goal typically involves:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying and grouping workloads by application</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining inter-application isolation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mapping the required ports and protocols</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Security Segmentation Assessment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adapts to your current stage in this journey by offering two scoring modes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Strict Mode</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – For environments where segmentation is complete and all essential firewall rules are in place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relaxed Mode</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – For environments still in transition, where applications and rules are being actively defined.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>Segmentation Score</strong> is determined by various factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Distributed Firewall In Operation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflects the operational state of DFW and Malicious IP blocking in the environment under consideration.</span></span></span></li>
<li><b>Infrastructure Protection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifies the percentage of Infrastructure Traffic (DHCP, DNS, LDAP/Secure LDAP, NTP) that is protected by a non-default DFW rule. </span><i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(A default rule is defined as a rule with Src=Any, Dst=Any, Service=Any and Action=Allow).</span></i></i></li>
<li><b>Environment Protection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifies the percentage of workloads in the environment that are covered by at least one rule configured under the Environment Category in DFW.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zone segmentation rules are typically configured under this category. This section of the score is to ensure that all workloads are assigned to an appropriate zone, and zone protection rules are in place to isolate or allow communication between them.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Application Protection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifies the percentage of application workloads that are covered by at least one rule configured under the Application Category in DFW and percentage of Application Traffic that is protected by a non-default DFW rule. </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, it rewards the DFW consumer for dropping all unidentified traffic both at the application level and datacenter level. </span><b><b><i>The distribution of weightage within the Application Protection section is determined by the mode selected during score computation.<br />
</i></b></b></li>
<li><b></b><b>Workloads without Obsolete OS &amp; Risky Protocols </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifies the percentage of workloads in the environment that are neither running Obsolete OS nor Risky Protocols. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Segmentation Report</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A detailed breakdown of the </span><b>Segmentation Score</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, analyzing up to 30 days of flow data and firewall policies to assess protection levels across all workloads. It is recommended to at least run the report over an interval of 7 days to derive accurate analysis and recommendations. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Visibility into vulnerabilities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> caused by risky protocols, outdated operating systems, or exposure to public IP addresses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Actionable insights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that complement existing Security Intelligence recommendations, allowing for rapid iteration and continuous posture improvement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p>Pwn2Own 2025 has been wrapped-up and we have witnessed successful exploitation of some of the very well-known products. Broadcom VMware products have been a part of Pwn2Own since 2016. Similar to last year, VMware ESXi – Type 1 and VMware Workstation – Type 2 Hypervisors were the targets in the virtualization category with a prize money of $180,000 and $80,000 respectively.</p>
<p>We have seen three successful attempts on our products in this year&#8217;s contest.</p>
<p>On day 2 &#8211; May 16, 2025, Nguyen Hoang Thach of STARLabs SG successfully exploited VMware ESXi. This is the first time VMware ESXi was exploited in Pwn2Own hacking event.</p>
<p>On Day 3 &#8211; May 17, 2025, Corentin BAYET of Reverse Tactics successfully exploited ESXi by chaining two vulnerabilities. One of vulnerabilities used in the exploit was a collision as it was already known. Later that day, Thomas Bouzerar and Etienne Helluy-Lafont from Synacktiv managed to successfully exploit Workstation.</p>
<p>We are actively working on the remediation and we plan to publish a VMware Security Advisory to provide information on updates for the affected products.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) for allowing us to participate. In addition, we would like to thank teams from STAR Labs SG, Reverse Tactics, and Synacktiv for working with us to address the reported issues.</p>

<p>For decades, enterprises have relied on perimeter defenses to protect their private cloud assets from external threats. Yet, in this era of ransomware, protecting only the perimeter has proven to be insufficient. Traditionally, only a handful of &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; applications were protected inside the private cloud. East-west traffic being ~4X more than north-south traffic, extending perimeter defenses internally proved neither scalable nor economically feasible. As a result, large portions of the private cloud remained vulnerable, enabling attackers to breach weakly protected non-critical workloads and laterally move to compromise high-value assets – crown jewels – ultimately causing significant damage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vdefend-distributed-firewall">VMware vDefend</a> is a software-defined, hypervisor-integrated security solution architected to comprehensively protect every VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) private cloud workload – including both critical and non-critical workloads. We are excited to announce new vDefend capabilities that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the enterprise’s micro-segmentation scope with planning and assessment,</li>
<li>Seamlessly scale lateral security across application environments,</li>
<li>Simplify lifecycle management and operations, and</li>
<li>Deploy threat detection in regulated environments with air-gapped NDR</li>
</ul>
<p>These capabilities are designed to accelerate the implementation of zero-trust lateral security in the VCF private cloud. They are especially critical in brownfield environments, which are poorly segmented, and application communication patterns are primarily unknown. Additionally, SE Labs (a leading cyber security test lab) has provided independent validation of vDefend’s real-world effectiveness.</p>
<p>Here are the key highlights:</p>
<p>Kickstarting Micro-segmentation Assessment and Planning</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Segmentation Report &#8211; Part of our Security Intelligence tool for lateral security visibility and threat analytics, the security segmentation report provides security teams and compliance officers with a clear assessment of the current segmentation health (via segmentation score), identifies gaps and offers actionable next steps to improve the segmentation posture. This is the magic bullet that enables enterprises to rapidly and comprehensively roll out zero-trust lateral security to combat ransomware.</li>
<li>Lateral Security for VCF validated solutions guide &#8211; A must-have, verified technical reference for quickly deploying VMware vDefend Zero Trust lateral security in VCF private clouds.</li>

<h3>Micro-segmentation as Code–Lateral Security at the Speed of Apps</h3>
<p>Most security gaps arise when applications are deployed first and then protected retroactively—a time-consuming approach that can leave workloads exposed to attackers for an extended period. VMware vDefend plug-n-play integrations with VCF address this issue by allowing you to define and apply security policies at the same time applications are spun up. Through a simple “as code” model, you can ensure that every new workload is protected from day one, eliminating the waiting period often associated with deploying workloads first and layering on security later.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarative Model &#8211; </strong>Allows operators to specify the full intent of an application security policy; vDefend then converts this intent into a working configuration, simplifying policy creation and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Automate Security with Tag-Based Policies &#8211; </strong>Define policies by application tags (e.g., dev, prod, test) for dynamic Zero Trust enforcement. As workloads are created or re-tagged, vDefend automatically applies the right policies—no manual reconfiguration needed.</li>
<li><strong>Expand with Scripting &#8211; </strong>Modern-day applications grow and shrink depending on demand.  With automation, customers can auto-scale security to ensure that applications stay safe and secure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are very happy to announce that SE Labs has awarded VMware vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) the <strong>AAA</strong> rating in Advanced Security testing.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-84228 alignleft" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa.png" alt="" width="169" height="311" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa.png 183w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa.png?resize=163,300 163w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the report, &#8220;<em>VMware vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention was tested against a range of hacking attacks designed to compromise systems and penetrate target networks in the same way as criminals and other attackers breach systems and networks. VMware vDefend ATP posted excellent results, detecting every targeted attack</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solution was put through a series of real-world attack scenarios aligned with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like Wizard Spider, Sandworm and Dragonfly/Dragonfly 2.0.</p>
<p>The fact that SE labs awarded vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention with it&#8217;s best possible AAA rating in this real world test, illustrates the strength of the real-world detection and correlation capabilities of the solution. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Metropolis-Medium, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.125rem;">Real-World Protection against fully featured attacks </span></p>
<p data-v-5bdddea5=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attackers often move from one system to another searching for the most valuable assets. The distributed nature of VMware vDefend, with detection and prevention controls applied at the network interface of every workload enables organizations to spot and stop attackers wherever and whenever they may act, without needing to deploy sensors or re-architecting the network. Along with the AAA rating, VMware vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention achieved an impressive 97% Total Accuracy Rating in the SE Labs test, detecting every targeted attack and tracking almost all hostile activities that occurred during the attacks.</span></p>
<p data-v-5bdddea5=""><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-84229" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png" alt="" width="635" height="199" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png 2484w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=768,241 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=1024,321 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=1536,482 1536w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=2048,642 2048w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/02/aaa2.png?resize=600,188 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></a></p>
<p data-v-5bdddea5=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">SE Labs adopted a rigorous testing methodology by executing comprehensive attacks that closely replicated the tactics employed by real-world cybercriminals. The testing process utilized a diverse array of tools and techniques to breach target systems, simulating complete attack chains to assess the product’s effectiveness. Each phase of the attack, from initial compromise to potential data theft or system disruption, was meticulously executed and monitored to ensure thorough evaluation. SE Labs references the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to showcase how the various TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) leverage in each attack map to the vDefend controls. </span></p>
<p>VMware vDefend is uniquely capable of protecting against complex multi-staged attacks through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention of Lateral movement</strong>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">By segmenting the network into smaller zones without network changes or hair-pinning, vDefend Firewall minimizes the attack surface and prevents attackers from moving laterally within the environment.</span></li>
<li><strong>Elimination of Visibility gaps</strong>: VMware vDefend Security Intelligence along with the rest of the vDefend stack is fully integrated with VMware Cloud Foundation and provides complete East-to-West visibility across workloads, applications and network traffic without the need to deploy any sensors or taps.</li>
<li><strong>Detecting Threats Everywhere</strong>: VMware vDefend ATP leverages behavioral analytics as well as signature-based detection to detect known and unknown attack techniques, wherever these may occur. Controls are applied in the &#8220;Goldilocks zone&#8221;, directly at the network interface of a workload, providing network-architecture independent protection with rich context and without needing &#8220;yet another&#8221; endpoint agent.</li>
<li><strong>Powered by AI</strong>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">During SE Labs&#8217; testing, the VMware vDefend platform achieved a very high degree of accuracy with virtually no false positives, reducing alert-overhead. Furthermore, vDefend ATP leverages AI and ML to correlate individual signals from IDPS, Malware Detection and Anomaly detection into prioritized and actionable campaigns, making it far easier for security teams to focus on the incidents that matter and ignore the noise.  With Intelligent Assist for VMware vDefend, we provide infrastructure and security teams with a Gen-AI powered co-pilot to further accelerate the time-to-insight and resolution. </span></li>

<p>VMware vDefend objects can be created in both the UI and API. The vDefend API can be interacted with using tools like Postman, cURL, and Terraform along with scripting languages like Python and Golang. In this guide, we will be using Postman. The API documentation can be found <a href="https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/nsx-t-data-center-rest-api/latest/">here</a> and has all the information you need to perform CRUD actions against the NSX Manager. In this article, we will be focusing on the absolute basics of how to use the NSX Policy API to gather information.</p>
<p>https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/nsx-t-data-center-rest-api/latest/</p>
<h2>Building the URL:</h2>
<p>All queries to the NSX Manager will start with what protocol we want to use and the FQDN/IP Address of the NSX Manager. Let&#8217;s assume our NSX Manager IP was 192.168.1.10. Whether it be using a scripting language like Python or using tools like Postman or cURL, we will query it like this:</p>
<p>https://10.10.1.105</p>
<p>When you want to gather information from NSX, we need to query it using a URI containing the object we want information about. For example, if we want to gather information about groups, we would use the following URI</p>
<p>/policy/api/v1/infra/domains/{domain-id}/groups</p>
<p>{domain-id} will be default when working with the global NSX Manager context.  So, the URI will look like this:</p>
<p>/policy/api/v1/infra/domains/default/groups</p>
<p>If we put the two parts above together, we will have the following:</p>
<p>https://10.10.1.105/policy/api/v1/infra/domains/default/groups</p>
<p>We need to couple this with a method like GET which will retrieve information based on the URL provided above.  In order to complete the get request we also need to couple this with authentication.  There are a few ways we can authenticate against the NSX Manager, but for this introduction, we will use the username and password of an admin account.</p>
<h2>Postman</h2>
<p>For Postman, we will configure Basic Authentication:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Basic-Auth-Screen.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84161" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Basic-Auth-Screen-1024x454.png" alt="" width="1024" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>In the picture above, I have set environment variables for username and password.  I encourage you to do the same with Postman.  For details on how to do this, please refer to the Postman documentation.</p>
<p>Now that we have authentication information set, we can prep for the call.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Get-Groups-Call-with-Params-Tab.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84160" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Get-Groups-Call-with-Params-Tab-1024x299.png" alt="" width="1024" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>With a GET call, we do not have to send any payload or body with the call.  We are getting information from the NSX Manager and expecting a payload in the response.</p>
<p>Now that we have all of our information set, we will execute the call in Postman.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Get-Groups-Result.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84159" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Get-Groups-Result-1024x641.png" alt="" width="1024" height="641" /></a></p>
<p>As we can see from the picture, we got a 200 status code which means it was successful.  For more information about status codes, please see the option content at the end of this article explaining return codes and their meaning.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder, groups are objects that contain a collection of one or more static or dynamic members, such as IP addresses or VMs. Groups are used in the source, destination or “Applied To” field of firewall rules.</p>
<p>We can see we received a payload containing information about all the groups configured in the NSX Manager.  We get information like:</p>
<p>&#8211; _revision</p>
<p>&#8211; ID</p>
<p>&#8211; display_name</p>
<p>&#8211; description</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each group will have all the properties of the group in a JSON format.  These things can later be modified with PUT, POST, and PATCH commands as well.  For now, we will continue to focus on GET.  Let&#8217;s say we want to get information about a singular group.  All we have to do, per the API documentation, is include a name of a group in the URI.  So let&#8217;s look for a group that we know already exists called &#8220;Windows&#8221;</p>
<p>https://10.10.1.105/policy/api/v1/infra/domains/default/groups/Windows</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Windows-Group.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84158" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Windows-Group-1024x658.png" alt="" width="1024" height="658" /></a></p>
<p>As we can see, we only received the Windows group information as opposed to the call we did earlier where we got all of the groups in the NSX Manager.  The URL above required us to query the group by the ID.  There are two ways we could get that information.  One way is querying for all of the groups like we did above and getting the ID from the result, or we can use the UI to get the path of the object like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Copy-Path-to-Clipboard.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84162" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/12/Copy-Path-to-Clipboard-1024x477.png" alt="" width="1024" height="477" /></a></p>
<p>/infra/domains/default/groups/Windows</p>
<p>Notice how the path matches what we had above after the /policy/api/v1/ part of the URI.</p>
<p>When writing code in python, GoLang, or any other scripting language, we would use the same logic to make calls against the NSX Manager.  We will show real examples in the next blog post.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a lot of euphoria around generative AI/GenAI today, not just among enterprises but also among threat actors wanting to cast a wider net for ransom. As these technologies evolve, they will be more deeply embedded into security workflows, helping enterprises stay ahead of emerging threats and enabling defenders to be more effective than ever. VMware vDefend has long been at the forefront of the AI/ML innovation journey, which includes the use of AI for micro-segmentation rule recommendation and applying ML to traffic flows and workload contexts to deliver granular insights. We have now embarked on the logical but important next step with GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to further enable customers to protect their crown jewels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, our team has been hard at work on an initiative known as Project Cypress. The result is Intelligent Assist for vDefend, powered by GenAI and LLM. This new capability simplifies the way virtualization, network security, and SOC teams understand detailed, contextual information about active threats and their impact. With just a few clicks, teams can initiate remediation, streamlining processes that once required complex workflows across multiple-point products. By democratizing threat response, Intelligent Assist for vDefend enables security and infrastructure teams to operate far more collaboratively to defend against ransomware attacks and make a greater impact.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decoding the Complexity of Security Threats and Alerts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the advent of Gen AI, correlating actions across campaigns or investigating the relationships between threats and alerts was a manual, time-consuming process. Attempts to integrate multiple-point solutions often introduced more complexity, increasing the risk of errors and visibility gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All too often, critical context around an event—such as what occurred before and after—was missed. While there are numerous systems to score the severity or impact of vulnerabilities, they lack the ability to communicate this information in clear, natural language across teams, making it challenging to assess the true scope of threat campaigns. Sharing Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for threat hunting has also been historically difficult for similar reasons.</span></p>
<p>Generative AI makes security operations faster and smoother. GenAI-powered tools significantly accelerate the ability of security teams to sift through large volumes of alerts, which would otherwise be overwhelming due to the high number of threats. GenAI can save hours—or even days—of manual efforts by intelligently prioritizing and correlating these alerts for appropriate remediation. This increase in speed translates directly to enhanced threat defense posture.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing Intelligent Assist for VMware vDefend</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, Intelligent Assist for VMware vDefend is an interactive chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated directly into the vDefend user interface (UI). This chatbot explains detection events in plain English, helping security teams grasp the full impact of threats while enhancing collaboration across the organization. It helps security teams grasp the full impact of threats while enhancing collaboration across the organization. This not only lowers the false positive rate but also accelerates the remediation process. With an easy-to-use natural language interface, analysts can ask specific questions to gain deeper contextual insights whenever needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key features of Intelligent Assist for VMware vDefend include its ability to explain threats in plain English, as well as its automated response and remediation capabilities. The platform is purposefully designed to offer a simple and intuitive user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive into these features.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explainability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a typical ransomware scenario involving data exfiltration via tools like dnscat, which creates an encrypted Command-and-Control (C&amp;C) over the DNS protocol. With our comprehensive set of IDS signatures, vDefend detects this malicious activity and generates a high-impact detection event. Intelligent Assist provides additional context for the SOC operator, revealing that other events suggest Darkside ransomware was the initial attack vector. Moreover, it confirms that the impact is significant but currently contained to a specific workload. With this information in hand, the SOC team can confidently conclude that the event is a true positive, prompting immediate action.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-24-at-10.07.37-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-84141" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-24-at-10.07.37-AM-1024x818.png" alt="" width="1024" height="818" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/Intelligent_Assist_Blog2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-84140 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/Intelligent_Assist_Blog2-703x1024.png" alt="" width="703" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent Assist’s ability to explain threats and events in plain English allows security, network and virtualization teams to immediately assess the scope and impact of individual threats. By automatically identifying related events and displaying Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), it eliminates visibility gaps across the security stack and accelerates time-to-insight far beyond what was previously possible.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic Response and Remediation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an event is verified as a true positive, rapid and effective remediation is crucial. This is where Intelligent Assist steps in again, taking automatic, immediate remediation actions while you continue gathering information and conducting forensic analyses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your risk tolerance and the potential impact on legitimate traffic and business productivity, you can choose between a targeted or comprehensive response:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Targeted response:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This approach focuses on narrow, specific remediation actions to minimize business disruption. However, this &#8216;scalpel-like&#8217; strategy carries the risk of not fully containing the attack.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Comprehensive response:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Broader in scope, this &#8216;hammer&#8217; approach is more likely to prevent lateral threat movement but poses a higher risk of disrupting normal business operations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever Intelligent Assist identifies an attack campaign, it recommends an appropriate response strategy. In the example below, involving an in-progress ransomware attack, Intelligent Assist has recommended a comprehensive remediation policy. While Intelligent Assist automates policy creation, it is not meant to be a fully autonomous system. The security team still has the final say—Intelligent Assist generates the policy, but it’s not enforced until reviewed and activated by a security expert. In this case, the recommended policy blocks all outbound DNS communication from the impacted workload to prevent further propagation of the threat.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seamless and Intuitive User Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing Intelligent Assist, we focused on making the end-user experience as seamless and intuitive as possible. Features like chat export allow users to easily save and share relevant insights from conversations with other teams, while built-in feedback mechanisms ensure the system&#8217;s responses improve over time. Intelligent Assist also recommends queries, helping even the least experienced users unlock its full potential. The administrative dashboard is built to simplify user management, and multi-user session support, along with workflow management tools, enhances collaboration among various teams. Deploying Intelligent Assist is effortless. The solution leverages a secure Chrome browser extension, providing a direct communication channel. Simply download the extension, and you&#8217;re ready to go.</span></p>

This empowers customers to establish their own private cloud within a secure and controlled data center environment, delivering scalability, rapid innovation, and effective cost management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is a crucial consideration for any cloud environment. Organizations should design and implement their VCF private cloud infrastructure using a zero-trust security approach to mitigate potential malicious activity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use case</span></h2>
<p>Building a secure VCF private cloud infrastructure is the foundation for protecting organizations&#8217; applications that run on top of it. The Management workload domain is a critical element of the VCF stack, hosting the resources that power VCF and ensure continuous operations. It is essential that the VCF workload and its management components be equally protected at the required level to prevent potential network intrusion activities and misuse and to establish a secure VCF operation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solution</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMware vDefend is the VCF integrated security solution that solves this matter through a distributed, scale-out architecture. The vDefend Distributed Firewall (DFW) is uniquely positioned outside the guest operating system but within the host itself, allowing it to protect the VCF private cloud in a way other solutions cannot. It provides a stateful L2-L7 firewall that is transparently applied to the workload&#8217;s network interface. This allows customers to implement any level of segmentation without redesigning the data center network infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCF 5.2 (NSX 4.2) introduced new capabilities for customers to secure VCF workloads regardless of the network backing (NSX VLAN and Overlay segments, and vSphere VLAN distributed port groups &#8211; DVPGs). This new capability simplifies VCF customers&#8217; security journey by allowing them to enforce security without the need for workload migration from vSphere virtual distributed switch (VDS) networking backing to NSX segments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, this also provides a simple, built-in approach to securing the VCF management components (SDDC Manager, vCenter Servers, NSX Managers, etc.) connected to vSphere DVPG.</span></p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-84095" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/VCF-Mgmt-WLD-NSX-on-DVPGs-1024x692.png" alt="" width="694" height="469" /></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To empower  VCF consumers with technical guidance on that matter, Broadcom&#8217;s Application Networking and Security (ANS) Division has published the &#8220;</span><a href="https://community.broadcom.com/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=d617ff32-eff2-ba15-eca8-0a820b779bb9&amp;forceDialog=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure VCF Management Workload Domain with VMware vDefend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; white paper. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document directs VCF architects, infrastructure, and security administrators through the steps to implement vDefend Distributed Firewall (DFW) and protect the VCF Management domain components. It includes examples of security policies, recommendations, and implementation workflows.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s evolving threat landscape, digital enterprises face sophisticated, laterally mobile cyberattacks within their private cloud environments. Traditional perimeter defenses are simply insufficient to secure east-west application traffic. Vulnerabilities such as Log4j and advanced malware such as Emotet serve as a wake-up call for all IT organizations. An effective security solution requires (1) comprehensive threat defense (including IDS/IPS, malware prevention, and network detection &amp; response), (2) micro-segmentation to ensure zero trust for applications and restrict lateral movement of threats, and (3) operating at large scale and performance to protect all applications. VMware vDefend has provided these advanced security capabilities with the </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vdefend-distributed-firewall"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Firewall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vdefend-advanced-threat-prevention"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Threat Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> portfolio to protect VCF private cloud application traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to unveil new vDefend Advanced Threat Prevention enhancements with the VCF 5.2.1 release: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>IDS/IPS Custom Signature Support:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For our distributed and hypervisor-integrated IDS/IPS offering, customers can now import their own custom IDS/IPS signatures or those sourced from third-party threat feeds, enabling tailored defenses against industry-specific attacks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Malware Analysis Test Drive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This capability allows customers to upload artifacts (files/URLs) for in-depth analysis, providing crucial insights into highly evasive malware and zero-day threats. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed IDS/IPS Enhancement – Custom IDS/IPS Signature Support</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">vDefend’s custom signature capabilities offer three key benefits: tailored defenses for applications, the ability to integrate third-party threat intelligence, and streamlined operational management of custom signatures. These features help enterprises stay ahead of evolving threats by customizing detection for their unique environments, incorporating industry-specific threat feeds, and simplifying signature lifecycle management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom signatures allow businesses to protect critical applications with tailored defenses. With vDefend&#8217;s distributed IDS/IPS, organizations can create and deploy custom signatures or import existing sets (Figure 1), providing comprehensive monitoring for specialized applications. Security teams can capture (Figure 2) and analyze real-time traffic, and the insights can be used to generate these signatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By integrating industry-specific intelligence from platforms like ICS-CERT for critical infrastructure/Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or from Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), such as FS-ISAC for financial services or H-ISAC for healthcare, customers can protect against targeted threats like attacks on SCADA systems, transaction fraud or breaches of personal health information (PHI). Additionally, the ability to consume non-industry-specific threat intelligence or threat-sharing platforms like MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), which offer early indicators of emerging threats, can help customers to &#8220;virtually patch&#8221; vulnerabilities by deploying customized signatures before official updates are released. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operationally, vDefend simplifies custom signature management with tools for lifecycle control, ensuring accuracy and performance. Logs for custom signatures (Figure 3) integrate into the product UI and can be exported to SIEM, while PCAP collection enables precise packet analysis, further enhancing detection and response.</span></p>

<h2><br style="font-weight: 400;" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malware Analysis Test Drive</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For vDefend Distributed Firewall users, the malware analysis test drive provides limited-time access to advanced malware analysis, allowing customers to upload artifacts (files and URLs) for detailed examination without impacting production systems. Security analysts, who are constantly seeking out new malware—sometimes even scouring the dark web for emerging threats—can use this feature to test malware samples in a secure sandbox environment. This allows them to understand the behavior of new and evasive threats, including zero-day exploits. The resulting reports provide deep visibility into how malware interacts with the CPU, memory, and network. With this powerful functionality, organizations can better understand the behavior of emerging threats and strengthen their defenses.</span></p>
<h2><br style="font-weight: 400;" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Next?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we push the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation for lateral (east-west) traffic, vDefend remains at the forefront of defending against advanced threats with its multi-layer defense-in-depth distributed security approach. The fact that vDefend is plug-and-play (fully integrated) with VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) private cloud, enables customers to deploy vDefend at speed and operate it at scale. Afterall, if lateral security roll-out is slow or it is not applicable to all workloads, the enterprise is really not secure. With vDefend, we are innovating across all aspects of lateral security.</span></p>
