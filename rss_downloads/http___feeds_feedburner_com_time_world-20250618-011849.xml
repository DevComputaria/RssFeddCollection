<p>The Constitution is pretty clear about the powers bestowed upon Presidents: they can negotiate treaties, command the military, stack a Cabinet and the courts, issue pardons and commutations. But the true superpowers of the presidency are more nebulous, but just as significant. Presidents can rally world-weary Americans to coalesce on foreign policy. They can rally America-weary countries to Washington&rsquo;s causes. They can exploit the instinctive respect for the presidency at moments of crisis.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>But for any of those softer powers to work, the White House has to have credibility. And, at the moment, President Donald Trump is at a pronounced disadvantage as he faces a Middle East in crisis. It isn&#8217;t just that he is coming off a weekend in which he provoked one of the largest single-day <a href="https://time.com/7294323/trumps-military-parade-took-over-washington-as-anti-trump-no-kings-protests-dominated-everywhere-else/" >protests</a> in U.S. history as he threw an underwhelming, but expensive, <a href="https://time.com/7294323/trumps-military-parade-took-over-washington-as-anti-trump-no-kings-protests-dominated-everywhere-else/" >military parade</a>. Trump could more easily dismiss his many detractors if his base were with him as solidly as it was just a few weeks ago. But the political movement that fueled his most unlikely return to power is threatening to now crack.</p>



<p>&#8220;We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/31531"  target="_blank">posted</a> on Tuesday, making clear the U.S. and Israel were now in lockstep on the Israeli military operation that the U.S. didn&#8217;t initially back. &#8220;Nobody does it better than the good ol&rsquo; USA,&#8221; he added. </p>



<p>It was the latest diplomatic swerve from Trump, who has responded in recent days to Israel&#8217;s offensive by veering to nearly every possible position&mdash;from a hands-off approach to pressing for a diplomatic off-ramp to claiming total ownership of Israel&#8217;s barrage and threatening Iran&rsquo;s annihilation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever one for theatrics, Trump this week even urged millions of Iranians to evacuate their capital ahead of suggested wasteland strikes. His Vice President, J.D. Vance, on Tuesday seemed to hint at further escalation&mdash;even as the architects of the MAGA movement he is <a href="https://time.com/7024414/jd-vance-2024-interview/" >usually more aligned</a> with are pushing Republicans to climb down from scorched-earth rhetoric.</p>



<p>There remains a window for this moment to deliver a clear political victory for Trump. Iran clearly wants to de-escalate its hot war with Israel, which is now in its fifth day and ostensibly over a nuclear program Israel sees as an existential threat. Israel pushed pause on plans to assassinate Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader after U.S. officials&mdash;including Trump&mdash;called it too outrageous. A return to a deal with Iran to put limits on its nuclear programs could give Trump diplomatic cache he has sought in that region since his first foreign trip as President in 2017. And nothing would shut down his haters faster than an objective win for U.S. interests.</p>



<p>But the political realities Trump finds himself navigating are different from the ones he has dispensed with in the past. As he pushes for Iran&rsquo;s surrender, here are the specific factions that are trying to guide his next steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the GOP Traditionalists</h2>



<p>Trump ran in 2024 on rich promises of fast ends to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, pledging peace deals were on the horizon if only he could get back into the White House. As he railed against his predecessors&rsquo; meddling into international affairs and flex of American might, the GOP traditionalists largely bit their tongues. After all, the alternative of Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris was still seen to them as less desirable than Trump&mdash;who proved pretty pliable on the global stage during his first term.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s an unbendable fact in GOP orthodoxy that the United States stands linked with Israel. As Washington&rsquo;s strongest ally in the region, support for Israel has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy since modern Israel&rsquo;s founding. To the dismay of critics of Israeli&rsquo;s governments over the years, that has sometimes been mistaken for a blank check. But the Establishment-minded Republicans are not going to be quiet if Trump is seen even hinting at a split with Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s government.</p>



<p>That said, those same Republicans are keeping a close eye on signals coming from the White House. It&rsquo;s no secret that Trump and Netanyahu do not have a terrific relationship. (Though Netanyahu hasn&rsquo;t <a href="https://time.com/7207325/gaza-ceasefire-trump-biden/" >exactly been besties</a> with any of his U.S. counterparts, dating back to Bill Clinton.) Yet for the moment, the GOP&rsquo;s hawks are trying to signal optimism. &ldquo;The Iranians are about to get their asses kicked,&rdquo; Fox host Mark Levin said this weekend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the MAGA Isolationists</h2>



<p>The core of Trump&rsquo;s MAGA base is far more distressed. Trump came to power by openly dinging internationalism from administrations of both parties. He vowed to retreat from foreign entanglements that began decades ago, wind down interventions that left Americans Googling for maps an ocean away, and double-down on a domestic agenda that better served his base. It was a clear play to a constituency that was unhappy with a creeping American reach.</p>



<p>Trump on Tuesday was testing the limits of that cohort&rsquo;s support, as he posted on social media that he knew where Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader was bunkering down and threatened his life unless Iran agreed to &ldquo;UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,&rdquo; Trump posted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This puts in motion a slow-rolling collision with Trump&rsquo;s base of supporters who thought they were walking away from other people&rsquo;s problems. Former Fox host <a href="https://time.com/6080432/tucker-carlson-profile/" >Tucker Carlson</a>, MAGA evangelist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-maga-iran-israel-2085940"  target="_blank">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/sen-rand-paul-says-it-s-not-the-u-s-s-job-to-be-involved-in-israel-iran-conflict-full-interview-241621061772?playlist=mmlsnnd_bestofnbc-nnd"  target="_blank">Sen. Rand Paul</a> have all spoken out against unequivocal support for Israel&rsquo;s actions. Rep. Tom Massie, a Republican who has bucked Trump with glee, on Tuesday <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/17/congress/thomas-massie-iran-resolution-war-powers-00410454"  target="_blank">introduced</a> a resolution that would block military escalation from the U.S. side.</p>



<p>After promising an end to entanglements that have bedeviled Trump&rsquo;s predecessors, Trump now seems on the cusp of joining the fray in a region where 40,000 Americans are deployed and there are scant off-ramps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1242271351.jpg" alt="GOLF: JUL 31 LIV Golf Invitational Series Bedminster" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the Pro-Israel Activists</h2>



<p>How the country feels about Israel belies party labels, even as Republicans are often the most vocally supportive. Trump owned the pro-Israel space in his campaigns. While Americans are pretty evenly split on the three-way question of whether U.S. support for Israel is just right, too weak, or too strong, there was a clear imbalance on how those camps voted last year. Trump carried 4 in 5 of those seeking more backing for Israel, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0"  target="_blank">exit polls</a>. (Vice President Kamala Harris, by contrast, carried two-thirds of the share who thought Washington was too pro-Israel.)</p>



<p>Trump clearly owes this constituency a chit. The pro-Israel lobby in Washington is highly organized to the point of sparking conspiracy theories. The clout is real and the consequences are significant. It reaches across the aisle, which is why even some of the most reliably liberal lawmakers still make the hike to AIPAC&rsquo;s policy conferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump has mastered the pander here. Despite his deep, deep antipathy toward Netanyahu, Trump understands the transactional nature of his relationship with those voters who prioritize Israel&rsquo;s future over any domestic U.S. priorities. Given that constituency&rsquo;s heft on the Hill, Trump gets that falling short with them could complicate everything else on his agenda, from tax cuts to immigration enforcement to crypto regulation to his beloved tariffs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the Christian Right</h2>



<p>There is some overlap with the pro-Israel cohort here, but for very different reasons. The Christian Right has a long-seeded allegiance with those who want U.S. support of Israel to be absolute. Trump carried Evangelicals and born-again Christians last year, again, by a 4-to-1 margin, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0"  target="_blank">exit polls</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many on the Christian Right, Israel&rsquo;s survival is a necessary component to Jesus&rsquo; return to the physical earth. In some readings of the Bible, a modern state of Israel is destined and will be where Jesus makes his second coming as prophesied in the so-called End Times. For many on the Christian Right, anything but fealty to Israel is an affront to their faith.</p>



<p>The overlap between Trump&rsquo;s isolationist base and his Israel-at-all-cost Evangelicals seems destined for a conflict, one with deep contradictions that has zero apparent resolution. The balancing act is not one that comes naturally to Trump, but he has time and time again proven capable of digging himself out of seemingly impossible dead ends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the Democrats</h2>



<p>Democrats have so far been measured in their response to the current strikes into Iran. No fans of a nuclear Iran, Democrats recall the landmark deal the Obama Administration negotiated with Tehran that Trump quickly abandoned in his first term. But Democrats also have pointed memories of how Netanyahu all but campaigned against Obama&rsquo;s re-election in 2012 in favor of Mitt Romney, a former colleague. And the long-festering frustrations with Netanyahu&rsquo;s administration cannot be overstated, even among Israel&rsquo;s strongest defenders in the Democratic caucus.</p>



<p>The opposition party is far from united in how they want to see the U.S. engage in the Middle East in this moment. Some voices, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have urged <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/17/politics/trump-iran-israel-conflict-g7"  target="_blank">restraint</a> against rushing to defer to Israel&rsquo;s efforts&mdash;putting leading leftists in an odd confluence with folks like Carlson and former Trump counselor Steve Bannon. Others, like Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, are mostly staying away from a bill Sanders has sponsored that would block funding for military force against Iran&mdash;despite the fact that Schumer sponsored similar legislation in 2020. Democrats are carefully watching where public opinion heads in the quick-moving situation or what might be done to curb Trump.</p>



<p>While the Jewish vote was just 2% of the total electorate last year, it was pretty unified for Democrats; 78% of Jewish voters backed Harris, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0"  target="_blank">exit polls</a>. Trump is no fool when it comes to optimism that Democrats would be natural allies here. But even his allies make for unsteady partners. Ultimately, Trump will need to figure out how to cobble together a coalition that permits him to execute a choice that he alone can make.</p>

<p>Both Cambodia and Thailand have been <a href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/cambodia-voted-worlds-friendliest-country-rough-guides-reader-poll"  target="_blank">rated</a> among the friendliest nations in the world, and just five years ago, the Southeast Asian neighbors thought their friendship with each other could never be broken. &ldquo;As we share a long border, we both know that we have to live and grow together,&rdquo; Thailand&rsquo;s then-Ambassador to Cambodia Panyarak Poolthup <a href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/thailand-cambodia-two-kingdoms-friendship-standing-test-time"  target="_blank">told</a> Cambodia&rsquo;s then-Prime Minister Hun Sen. &ldquo;The political will is always there to resolve any issues that may arise.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>But in recent weeks, bilateral relations have sunk to a dangerous new low, threatening to reignite a historic rivalry that had seemed to be a relic of the past.</p>



<p>Following weeks of standoff, including Cambodia invoking the language of &ldquo;war,&rdquo; since a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash along the border last month, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra issued her strongest rebuke yet, signaling resolution likely remains distant.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thailand is united. We will not tolerate maltreatment, accusations or threats from any party. Our country also has dignity. Our country is also strong,&rdquo; Paetongtarn <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3050711/strident-pm-declares-thailand-will-defend-its-sovereignty"  target="_blank">said</a>, in response to Cambodia retaliating with cross-border embargoes and taking the dispute to the International Court of Justice, which Thailand does <a href="https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/asean/40051314"  target="_blank">not recognize</a> the jurisdiction of.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about the conflict&mdash;and its potential consequences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What has happened in recent weeks?</h2>



<p>The reescalation of conflict was sparked on May 28, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in an early morning clash between both nations&rsquo; troops, in an area called the Emerald Triangle&mdash;the shared border between Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. The area remains disputed as both Thailand and Cambodia lay claims to parts of the region.</p>



<p>Both sides argued that the other was the aggressor: Cambodia&rsquo;s Ministry of National Defense <a href="https://mod.gov.kh/contents/uploads/2025/05/IMG_20250528_0001.pdf"  target="_blank">said</a> the Thai army opened fire on a trench that had been a Cambodian army base, leading to the death of the soldier, while Thailand&rsquo;s army <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3036327/thai-cambodian-soldiers-in-brief-clash-no-casualties"  target="_blank">claimed</a> that its soldiers responded only after the Cambodian forces &ldquo;started using weapons&rdquo; during a misunderstanding in the disputed area.</p>



<p>Hun Sen, who relinquished the Cambodian premiership to his son in 2023 but became the Senate President and remains the effective country leader, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hunsencambodia/posts/1321171426031308?ref=embed_post"  target="_blank">reacted</a> to the skirmish, saying that he supports the &ldquo;decision to send troops and heavy weapons to the border to prepare for a counterattack in case of a further invasion.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We hate war, but we are compelled to wage it when facing foreign aggression,&rdquo; Hun Sen said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As members of the regional bloc Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Cambodia and Thailand are expected to resolve disputes peacefully, per the <a href="https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/images/archive/publications/ASEAN-Charter.pdf"  target="_blank">ASEAN charter</a>. While both countries <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/7/thailand-and-cambodia-reinforce-troops-along-disputed-border-thai-minister"  target="_blank">initially beefed up</a> military presence on their respective sides of the border, on June 8, they appeared to attempt a deescalation by sending their troops back to military positions that were agreed upon last year. Paetongtarn, in a <a href="https://x.com/ingshin/status/1931685763273605120"  target="_blank">statement,</a> said the countries agreed &ldquo;to jointly adjust military forces at points of conflict to reduce the atmosphere of confrontation.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But the dispute escalated through punitive tit-for-tat policies seemingly designed to appease fomenting nationalistic sentiment on their respective sides of the border.</p>



<p>The Thai army <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3044047/thai-army-takes-control-of-border-checkpoints"  target="_blank">took control</a> of border checkpoints and Bangkok <a href="https://www.nationthailand.com/news/asean/40051025"  target="_blank">threatened</a> to cut electricity and the internet to Cambodia. Cambodia <a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-internet-tv-movie-ban-1d554bda4b59aa89b79f02ad2913acc7"  target="_blank">responded</a> by banning Thai media like TV and movies, and disconnecting cross-border internet links to Thailand. On June 17, Cambodia banned <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PhnomPenhPost/posts/pfbid02RfFS8YaxganZLn795wngg7tRZPivYd2FsNvPzmmxAEZEU8XjFjjTnMVzpuuii8rcl"  target="_blank">Thailand&rsquo;s export of produce into the country</a>. Thailand, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3051507/army-prohibits-thais-crossing-border-to-work-in-poipet-bars-casinos"  target="_blank">barred</a> Thais from crossing the border to work in casinos and other entertainment venues in Cambodia&rsquo;s Poipet. </p>



<p>Further inflaming tensions, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announced on Facebook on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid026SS4TiFZtKibtNmYqZVooHPDBU6nzzdSrjE9omBTjGoXZTyqmNGWKZj3DZLNWHEkl&amp;id=100069511484329&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWvdc4SnFJC9ooA8PqkAcYKSSvjMZU99szxLKfB5UlqIVeOg7NyS-9CpyXbDM-zU0X-YvO2U3wS_ZsR1rcsqISDhrIBJuRnJL2vlPyU_v7WbelOI7ENQlQmWY7GboZIun2GWrnbUw2XU1bxRfC-6B7X5ldaweHMxG03ozp5kHehqea7r63XdXYULOPq5q6YrQxO-iEunOg0fmU6IUywp-Za&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"  target="_blank">June 16</a> that Cambodia sent an official letter to the International Court of Justice to help find a solution to the border development issues. &ldquo;Cambodia chooses international law and peace,&rdquo; he said the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0K3AAGz5m3BSJhbtYW7CQ4vak3L63GzPmQsKEvENzChD4HoRAvrFz7PeDFisuyuvkl&amp;id=100069511484329&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWAlvkGWwDvwZKKMid4dcJLGsyBv0u5Sj4-xTTdpfaQvIx7MOBNniUWeThVLSyS5__XB71NvOWpXPVx8p3QmnETi72L0diGS2PYvn90DlfwxQBhEecyxTYmL0iFPu4dmEVd3MIBX-mTlXDECAtzNzbBtqimo4b8oW1g1hfVISlpQ4NW0-e2WwYuCTvUCItEecaKPusk_mZSbFVsTM9iUZwP&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"  target="_blank">day before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thailand&rsquo;s foreign ministry has <a href="https://www.mfa.go.th/en/content/thai-position-response-to-cambodia-icj-en?cate=5d5bcb4e15e39c306000683c"  target="_blank">ruled out</a> an intervention from the ICJ and made clear its preference for bilateral talks, arguing that &ldquo;a third party may not always be conducive to the preservation of amicable relations among States, particularly in sensitive matters involving complex historical, territorial, or political dimensions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the historic context?</h2>



<p>Cambodia and Thailand share an 817-km. land border, but that border was largely mapped by French colonizers while they occupied Cambodia from 1863 to 1953. A 1907 map was based on an agreement to follow a natural watershed line between Thailand and Cambodia. But Thailand later contested the map over the fact that it placed the 11th-century Preah Vihear Temple in the D&acirc;ngr&ecirc;k Mountains within Cambodian territory.</p>



<p>The dispute, as well as <a href="https://www.nationthailand.com/news/asean/40051324"  target="_blank">historical differences</a> in cartographic methods, led to areas around the border that both countries lay claim to.</p>



<p>There have been attempts to clarify demarcations. Cambodia brought Thailand to the International Court of Justice in 1959 over the temple dispute, and in 1962 the court <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/45/4873.pdf"  target="_blank">ruled</a> in Phnom Penh&rsquo;s favor, saying that Preah Vihear falls in Cambodian territory. Thailand recognized this at the time but argued that the surrounding frontiers were still disputed, which further complicated the borderlines.</p>



<p>Tensions flared in 2008 when Cambodia sought a UNESCO world-heritage status for the Preah Vihear Temple. After the temple received the recognition in July, military clashes between Cambodian and Thai troops <a href="https://time.com/archive/6944665/thai-cambodian-border-spat-heats-up/" >erupted</a> near the border area.</p>



<p>These clashes lasted for years, coming to a head in <a href="https://time.com/archive/6957211/deadly-clashes-as-thai-cambodian-temple-tensions-reignite/" >2011</a>, after displacing 36,000 at the height of the conflict in <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/cambodia/cambodia-thailand-36000-displaced-deadly-border-clashes"  target="_blank">April that year</a>. Around this time, Cambodia took to the ICJ again to interpret its earlier 1962 ruling, and the court affirmed its previous decision two years later.</p>



<p>Thailand has pushed for a more bilateral approach, with a Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) established in 2000 to help resolve border disputes. Cambodia has engaged with Thailand through the JBC, but these meetings&mdash;the latest of which was scheduled on June 14 in Phnom Penh&mdash;tend to produce <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3050052/no-conclusions-from-thai-cambodian-joint-boundary-meeting"  target="_blank">no significant results</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What could come next?</h2>



<p>Resolving the border dispute quickly seems unlikely.</p>



<p>Complicating matters is the relationship between the two countries&rsquo; current leaders&mdash;and their fathers. Paetongtarn&rsquo;s father former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet&rsquo;s father Hun Sen have a public friendship, with Hun Sen even providing refuge to Thaksin in Cambodia and naming him as an <a href="https://time.com/archive/6948517/latest-pawn-in-the-thai-cambodian-spat-thaksin/" >honorary economic adviser</a> after Thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006.</p>



<p>The relationship between the two has caused concern about how the border dispute will be resolved, particularly for Thailand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Paetongtarn was asked about whether she&rsquo;s becoming &ldquo;too soft&rdquo; on Cambodia because of the relationship, she <a href="https://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2025/06/05/thailand-cambodia-border-tensions-rise-with-nationalism/"  target="_blank">responded</a>: &ldquo;Even though our two families are friends, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we would allow the country to lose its interests &hellip; if a friend asks for your house, no friend would just give it away.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paetongtarn&rsquo;s comments come as the Royal Thai Army said it was ready for a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-military-prepared-high-level-operation-if-cambodia-border-row-escalates-2025-06-06/"  target="_blank">high-level operation</a>&rdquo; if necessary to address the situation at the border. Paetongtarn has reiterated calls for a peaceful resolution to the dispute, but being at odds with the Army has echoes of previous government downfalls: both her father Thaksin and aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, another former Prime Minister, were ousted following nationalists groups&rsquo; revival of border issues.</p>



<p>In an analysis for Asian current affairs magazine <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/is-thailand-on-the-cusp-of-another-military-coup/"  target="_blank"><em>The Diplomat</em></a>, Royal University of Phnom Penh&rsquo;s Center for Southeast Asian Studies researcher Rath Pichanvorlak warned that the Thai military &ldquo;could allow border tensions to escalate, inflaming nationalist sentiment,&rdquo; to justify another coup.</p>

<div class="brief-podcast-player"><h3 class="podcast-title">The Brief June 17, 2025</h3><h4>Updates on the rise of political violence in the U.S., Israel and Iran, and more</h4><p>Podcast ID &#8211; Short Length: <code>d172b396-a05f-49a8-91f4-5e9ecff5874e</code></p><p>Podcast ID &#8211; Long Length: <code>34e224e1-2194-42f7-a6bb-b33a19e61436</code></p></div>

<p>Just four days into its <a href="https://time.com/7294609/iran-israel-war-pictures-strike/" >ferocious air campaign</a>, Israel appears to have gained a decisive edge in its escalating conflict with Iran: aerial supremacy over Iran.</p>



<p>The Israeli military said Monday that it can now fly over the country&#8217;s capital, Tehran, without facing major resistance after crippling Iran&rsquo;s air defenses in recent strikes, enabling Israel to hit an expanding range of targets with relative ease. </p>



<p>Such control over Iran&rsquo;s skies, military analysts say, is not just a tactical advantage&mdash;it&rsquo;s a strategic turning point. Air supremacy gives Israel the freedom to escalate its bombing campaign, look for additional targets, and possibly redraw the rules of deterrence in a region where missile salvos and proxy wars have long defined the limits of conflict.</p>



<p>Soon after declaring control of Tehran&rsquo;s skies, Israel warned residents and workers in the capital to evacuate, and later appeared to strike the headquarters of Iran&rsquo;s state television broadcaster while anchors were live on air. It was a symbolically potent moment: a demonstration not just of reach, but of psychological dominance.</p>



<p>Israel&rsquo;s aerial ascendancy is not free of risks. Backed into a corner, the Iranian regime may consider its survival at stake and could take more extreme measures. Iran has limited tools given the setbacks it has suffered over the last two years, but it still has terrorist proxies around the world and has attempted assassinations of major figures in the past. It might also try to sprint for a nuclear weapon in one of its remaining underground facilities.</p>



<p>The Israeli offensive&mdash;codenamed Operation Rising Lion&mdash;<a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >was launched Friday </a>after the IAEA concluded that Iran had moved closer to the threshold of producing a nuclear weapon. Since then, Israel has carried out one of the <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >most intense and far-reaching air operations</a> in its history, targeting nuclear sites, missile launchers, airports, and senior figures in Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>



<p>Prime Minister <a href="https://time.com/7294186/israel-warns-tehran-will-burn-deadly-strikes-traded-nuclear-program/" >Benjamin Netanyahu</a> has said the strikes will continue until both Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities and missile stockpiles are destroyed. U.S. President <a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday morning backed Israel&#8217;s declaration that Tehran has lost control of Iran&rsquo;s airspace: &ldquo;We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699514822488706"  target="_blank">posted on Truth Social</a>. &ldquo;Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn&rsquo;t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured &lsquo;stuff.&rsquo;  Nobody does it better than the good ol&rsquo; USA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while the air campaign has given Israel the upper hand militarily, it has also hardened diplomatic dead-ends. Richard Nephew, the former Deputy Special Envoy for Iran under the Biden Administration, says that reviving nuclear negotiations with Iran is now &ldquo;infinitely harder than it used to be&rdquo; because the U.S. has shown it can withdraw from an agreement at any time and is unable to control its ally in Israel. &ldquo;The idea of finding a sustainable, permanent deal here has taken a big hit as a result of Israeli military action,&rdquo; he says, adding that Trump&#8217;s 2018 withdrawal from the original nuclear agreement was the catalyst for the current crisis. &ldquo;We had a nuclear deal that was working. His own administration was saying it was working.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Now, with Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program damaged but not destroyed, and its retaliatory missile strikes continuing, military analysts say Israel may double down on the advantage its air superiority provides: more strikes, more decapitation efforts, and potentially even covert ground operations&mdash;backed by an air force that now roams Iranian skies largely unchallenged.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about Israel&rsquo;s air supremacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does it mean to have air supremacy?</h2>



<p>Air supremacy is the most complete form of aerial dominance a military can achieve. It means an air force can strike targets across a country at will, without major opposition from enemy aircraft or air defenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Israel to claim this over Iran just days after the strikes began is an impressive military accomplishment, says Michael Knights, the Bernstein Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute who specializes in Middle Eastern security. &ldquo;It&#8217;s exceptional to get this level of freedom. I&rsquo;m quite surprised that they&rsquo;ve managed it,&rdquo; he says, noting that not even the U.S. had been able to establish air superiority over the Houthis despite spending around $1 billion on the effort, losing over 20 major drone systems in the process.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Air superiority gives you a real edge when it comes to keeping the enemy stationary or watching whenever they try to move,&rdquo; Knights says, suggesting that Israel may use it to track key targets like nuclear facilities or where certain Iranian leaders live. The air advantage also allows Israel to bomb &ldquo;around the clock instead of just at night&rdquo; without real fear of being shot down, he adds.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" ><em>Israel Gets the War It Wanted</em></a></p>



<p>Israel began the war using its most advanced stealth aircraft, the F-35, enhanced with intelligence-gathering modifications to fly deep into Iranian territory and strike Iran&rsquo;s air defense radar installations and surface-to-air missile batteries. After suppressing most of Iran&rsquo;s air defenses, Israel sent older fighter jets, including F-15s and F-16s, to join the operation and began dropping JDAMs and SPICE bombs&mdash;relatively inexpensive compared to missiles&mdash;on an expanding list of military sites, some of them within the heart of Tehran.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/israel-iran-conflict-2025-05.jpg" alt="Israel Iran Conflict" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Unlike Russia, which has failed to achieve similar air dominance in Ukraine after more than three years of war, Israel has accomplished it in a matter of days. Analysts credit superior training, tighter integration with intelligence and cyber operations, and the element of surprise.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The two previous Israeli retaliatory operations in 2024 taught them that they could operate within Iranian airspace relatively freely,&rdquo; Knights says. &ldquo;First you take out its command and control, its communications, radar&hellip;and pretty soon you can operate drones in daylight over Tehran.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much damage can Israel do from the air?</h2>



<p>With aerial supremacy, Israel&rsquo;s destructive potential has increased exponentially. Without needing to rely on costly long-range missiles, Israeli jets can now fly directly over Iranian targets, drop cheaper precision bombs, and strike with greater frequency.</p>



<p>Knights says that the Israeli military will likely try to destroy the entire Iranian Navy and Iran&rsquo;s weapon storage facilities, military and civilian fuel storage sites, and national security buildings. But he notes that Israel will not be able to strike some of Iran&rsquo;s major uranium enrichment sites, like Fordow, a nuclear facility that is buried deep within a mountain and is considered nearly impervious to conventional airstrikes. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have bunker busters that are good enough,&rdquo; he says. </p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7294791/iran-state-tv-israel-strike/" ><em>Watch The Moment Israel Strikes Iranian State Television During Live Broadcast</em></a></p>



<p>Israeli officials have said its military has prepared at least two weeks of strikes, though that could <a href="https://time.com/7294360/trump-warns-iran-bloody-conflict-israel-death-toll-rises/" >change if the U.S. increases its involvement.</a> The U.S. military has already helped shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel, and Trump appears to want a full surrender from Iran rather than a ceasefire.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699610769479275"  target="_blank">social media post</a> on Tuesday morning, Trump said the U.S. knows the location of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but doesn&rsquo;t want him killed &ldquo;for now.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We know exactly where the so-called &lsquo;Supreme Leader&rdquo; is hiding,&rdquo; Trump wrote. &ldquo;He is an easy target, but is safe there&mdash;We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don&rsquo;t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!&rdquo; Trump wrote in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699621000737127"  target="_blank">follow up post</a>.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s latest comments were likely welcomed by the Israelis, who &ldquo;were quite concerned about what kind of deal Donald Trump was going to make&rdquo; with the Iranians, Nephew says. That prompted them to &ldquo;act now, as opposed to waiting to see what else would come from the negotiating process.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" ><em>How Involved Was the U.S. in Israel&rsquo;s Attack on Iran?</em></a></p>



<p>Already, Israel has destroyed more than 120 surface-to-surface missile launchers&mdash;roughly a third of Iran&rsquo;s total&mdash;along with two F-14 aircraft, dozens of command centers, and critical infrastructure supporting Iran&rsquo;s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The strike on Mashhad airport, 1,400 miles from Israel, was the longest-range attack in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iran is depleting its stockpiles of missiles and drones in repeated attempts to retaliate. Iran&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, said that more than 220 civilians in Iran have been killed since the start of Israel&#8217;s offensive, including 20 children, while more than 1,000 people have been injured. The Israeli prime minister&#8217;s office says that at least 24 people have been killed by Iran&#8217;s retaliatory strikes against Israel, and nearly 600 injured.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Iran has turned out to be much weaker than we had assumed, and yet it&rsquo;s still standing,&rdquo; says Alex Vatanka, a Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute who specializes in Iranian security affairs. He adds that the Iranians know the U.S. is the only country that can stop Israel from attacking, and that Iran&rsquo;s leaders are asking for talks to resume as long as the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t join the attack. &ldquo;Israel definitely cannot stay in this fight for the long haul without the U.S.,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But Netanyahu is saying to Trump, please let me finish the job.&rdquo;</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>As the war between Israel and Iran rages on for a fifth day, it is unclear whether the Trump Administration is preparing to intervene militarily. On Monday, <a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >U.S. forces were sent to the Middle East</a>, ostensibly for &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; purposes, as Donald Trump left the G7 summit early and warned Tehran to evacuate.</p>



<p>But whether the U.S. gets more involved <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" >than it already is</a>, some members of Congress from both parties argue, is not a decision that should be up to the President.</p>



<p>Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced plans to introduce a resolution on Tuesday that asserts the requirement of Congress&rsquo; approval if Trump wants to commit armed forces to military action in the region.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is not our war. But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution,&rdquo; Massie <a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1934749340813476204"  target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>



<p>The resolution has already gained the support of progressive Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1934791134049341538"  target="_blank">replied</a> &ldquo;Signing on&rdquo; to Massie&rsquo;s post.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also not the first proposal by a lawmaker seeking to limit U.S. military engagement in the conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=KBP7sVeC autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced a <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/iran_war_powers_resolution.pdf"  target="_blank">war powers resolution</a> in the upper chamber on Monday that would terminate the unauthorized use of U.S. armed forces against Iran, given that there has not been a declaration of war, which only Congress can issue. War powers resolutions are &ldquo;privileged,&rdquo; meaning that the Senate is required to promptly debate and vote on the resolution.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,&rdquo; Kaine said in a <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-announces-the-filing-of-a-war-powers-resolution-to-prevent-war-with-iran"  target="_blank">statement</a>. &ldquo;This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation&rsquo;s men and women in uniform into harm&rsquo;s way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also introduced a separate <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/DAV25B57.pdf"  target="_blank">bill</a>, cosponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), on Monday that would prohibit the use of federal funds for &ldquo;any use of military force in or against Iran&rdquo; without congressional approval, with the exception of self-defense.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,&rdquo; Sanders said in a <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-introduces-no-war-against-iran-act/"  target="_blank">statement</a>. &ldquo;I will do everything that I can as a Senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the US from being drawn into another war.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While the measures seeking to constrain Trump are unlikely to pass in the Republican-majority House or Senate, proponents have said that they want to force lawmakers to show where they stand on an issue where the public has been very clear. According to a <a href="https://criticalissues.umd.edu/sites/criticalissues.umd.edu/files/Questionnaire_May2025.pdf"  target="_blank">University of Maryland poll in May</a>, before Israel <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >launched its strikes against Iran last Friday</a>, only 14% of U.S. respondents across political parties supported &ldquo;Military action in attempt to destroy Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for every member to go on record,&rdquo; Khanna <a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/1934782903935697058"  target="_blank">posted</a>. &ldquo;Are you with the neocons who led us into Iraq or do you stand with the American people?&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the Constitution says</h2>



<p>War powers are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/war_powers"  target="_blank">divided</a> between Congress and the President, according to the Constitution. While the President is named the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, only Congress has the authority to decide whether the U.S. should go to war&mdash;either a total war or more limited uses of force. The President retains inherent defensive powers to use military force without congressional authorization if the U.S. is attacked, but congressional approval is still needed for a prolonged war.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/news/war-powers-resolution-1973"  target="_blank">War Powers Resolution of 1973</a> provided further guidance on the President&rsquo;s war powers, including that the President must have congressional approval for the use of force abroad except for certain circumstances like safely removing troops or rescuing Americans overseas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the executive branch has expanded its view of the President&rsquo;s defensive war powers, most notably with its interpretations of the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations of Use of Military Force (AUMF). Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf?ref=hir.harvard.edu"  target="_blank">2001 AUMF</a> after the September 11 attacks to allow the use of force against entities that &ldquo;planned, authorized, committed, or aided&rdquo; in the attacks or &ldquo;harbored such organizations or persons.&rdquo; The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/114/text?ref=hir.harvard.edu"  target="_blank">2002 AUMF</a> authorized military action against Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Iraq government &ldquo;to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq&rdquo; and was used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>



<p>But the authorizations have been <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/what-the-aumf-is-and-why-you-should-care-2018/"  target="_blank">criticized</a> for effectively giving Presidents a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fcnl.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/UncheckedWar.AUMFLimits.pdf"  target="_blank">blank check</a>&rdquo; to direct military actions without congressional approval <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/runaway-authorization-tower-22/"  target="_blank">far beyond</a> their original intended scope. There have been multiple <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/03/22/the-u-s-senate-repealed-iraq-war-authorizations-a-year-ago-in-the-house-theyre-frozen/"  target="_blank">unsuccessful efforts</a> by both parties to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007363054/congress-is-poised-to-take-back-some-of-its-war-powers-from-the-president"  target="_blank">repeal</a> the authorizations, including by Kaine in 2023 with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/republican-senators-oppose-iraq-war-aumf-repeal-2023-3"  target="_blank">support</a> of then-Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2270101/aumf-mirage-republicans-still-hawkish-on-war-powers-despite-support-for-repeal/"  target="_blank">said at the time</a>: &ldquo;I think the fact that you have a lot of Republicans who are very skeptical of continuing to provide a blank check here I think is a good sign.&rdquo;</p>



<p>When Trump in his first term authorized the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, Defense Department general counsel explained at the time that it distilled the President&rsquo;s constitutional and statutory authority to direct military action into a broad <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2181868/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-byu-law-school/"  target="_blank">two-part test</a>: first, &ldquo;whether the President could reasonably determine that the action serves important national interests,&rdquo; and second, whether the military action does not necessarily &ldquo;bring the nation into the kind of protracted conflict that would rise to the level of a &lsquo;war.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Party splits</h2>



<p>Conflict with Iran has divided <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5350106-israel-iran-conflict-democrats/"  target="_blank">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/israel-iran-conflict-splits-maga-leaving-trump-navigate-rcna212786"  target="_blank">Republicans</a>&mdash;not along party lines but within them.</p>



<p>While some &ldquo;America First&rdquo; voices have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/13/the-intra-gop-fight-over-israels-strikes-on-iran"  target="_blank">rallied against</a> direct U.S. involvement, Trump&rsquo;s MAGA camp also includes war hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1933569381881053429"  target="_blank">said</a> on X that, if negotiations fail, the U.S. should &ldquo;go all-in to help Israel finish the job.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there&rsquo;s nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program,&rdquo; Graham <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-richard-blumenthal-connecticut-lindsey-graham-south-carolina-face-the-nation-transcript-06-15-2025/"  target="_blank">said</a> on CBS on Sunday. &ldquo;If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. &hellip; If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Nine lawmakers led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a pro-Israel Democrat, signed onto a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25976120-gottheimer-bacon-letter-trump-iran/"  target="_blank">letter</a> imploring Trump to apply &ldquo;crushing diplomatic pressure in addition to Israel&rsquo;s military pressure&rdquo; on Iran towards zero nuclear enrichment.</p>



<p>Trump, who also faces <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/14/israel-iran-war-us-nuclear-program-trump"  target="_blank">pressure from Israel</a> to join the war, has continued to urge finding a diplomatic solution to the conflict, but he&rsquo;s also expressed the possibility of U.S. involvement if Iran retaliates against U.S. targets.</p>



<p>&ldquo;If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">posted</a> on Truth Social on Saturday night, &ldquo;the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, in December 1953, <em>Dragnet</em> became the first American television show to broadcast in color, few fans knew they had a dusty nook on the California-Nevada border to thank for bringing it to polychromatic life. But every early cathode-ray tube color television owed its screen&rsquo;s red hue to europium, a rare earth element excavated and processed exclusively at the Mountain Pass Mine in San Bernardino County.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>From the 1950s to the 1980s, Mountain Pass produced practically all known quantities of europium, as well as over 90% across the spectrum of rare earth minerals worldwide. Back then, of course, uses were limited: apart from europium adding vibrancy to L.A. cop procedurals, cerium was used as a glass polishing agent, while lanthanum was&mdash;and still is&mdash;crucial for oil cracking, or turning crude into gasoline and other lighter fuels.</p>



<p>Today, however, the picture is very different. Rare earth materials are vital for myriad industries, from advanced weaponry to wind turbines and robotics. But far from the U.S. having a monopoly on production, now some 96% of rare earth minerals are sourced from China, propelling these arcane materials into center stage in the escalating trade war between the world&rsquo;s top two economies.</p>



<p>In response to President Donald Trump imposing tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, as well as curbing the sale of strategic U.S. technology including semiconductor chips, China hit back by restricting the export of rare earth elements. Auto <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-rare-earth-export-curbs-risk-halting-german-car-production-lobby-group-2025-06-03/"  target="_blank">manufacturers</a> across the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Germany and India have warned the shortages may <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/#:~:text=German%20automakers%20became,factories%20could%20close."  target="_blank">force factories</a> to halt production.</p>



<p>The spat prompted Trump to hit out at China for reneging on a nascent trade deal between the superpowers. Then, last week, Trump <a href="https://time.com/7292207/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-timeline/" >revealed</a> a &ldquo;framework&rdquo; struck in London that supposedly will ease U.S. access to China&rsquo;s rare earth minerals and magnets in exchange for setting tariffs on Chinese exports at 55% and a relaxing of <a href="https://time.com/7289945/us-china-trump-rubio-international-student-visa-restrictions-trade-negotiations/" >curbs on Chinese students&rsquo; access</a> to U.S. colleges. &ldquo;Full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China,&rdquo; Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>



<p>But reports from Washington suggest that the deal will expire in just six months, and with U.S.-China relations continuing to spiral, how America and its allies can break itself free of its Chinese rare earth dependency is a geopolitical priority. While it&rsquo;s a question with sweeping economic ramifications, it&rsquo;s also one with no easy answer.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Everybody wants to just snap their fingers and start producing heavy rare earth elements,&rdquo; says Mark Smith, CEO of rare earths firm NioCorp, who has worked in the industry for almost four decades. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a very long, hard process. And the longer we wait, the further China gets ahead.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>China has bet on rare earths for a long time. Back in 1992, reformist leader Deng Xiaoping declared: &ldquo;The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.&rdquo;</p>



<p>China accompanied this strategic focus with billions of dollars of investment in mines and processing facilities to monopolize the market. Just like countless strategic industries, China wielded huge state subsidies, and little concern for environmental or safety standards, to produce rare earths at a fraction of the cost of Western competitors.</p>



<p>As a result, in 1998, Mountain Pass&rsquo; separation plant ceased producing refined rare earth compounds. Four years later, a toxic waste spill led the mine to close altogether, and intense Chinese competition impelled the decision not to reopen.</p>



<p>At the same time, uses of rare earths were just ramping up. Today, yttrium is used in lighting and flat screens; ytterbium in cancer treatments and earthquake monitoring; erbium in lasers and fiberoptic cables. But particularly important are permanent rare earth magnets, which account for a quarter of total rare earths consumption and are a vital component in actuators, or devices that turn a control signal into mechanical motion. These could be robot arms on assembly lines, the fins of a ballistic missile or stealth bomber, or any of the multiple motors of an electric vehicle.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s not just EVs that rely on actuators and, by extension, permanent rare earth magnets. Conventional internal combustion engine vehicles are also heavily reliant on these materials. That is how, in 2010, China managed to bring Japan&rsquo;s auto industry to the brink of collapse by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html"  target="_blank">halting</a> exports of rare earth materials amid a territorial spat in the East China Sea.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-104550998.jpg" alt="Pentagon Losing Control of Bombs to China's Monopoly" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>In the following year, prices of rare earths <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/japan-rare-earths-huge-deposit-of-metals-found-in-pacific.html#:~:text=As%20a%20major%20electronics%20manufacturer,sources%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Journal."  target="_blank">soared</a> by 10 times and the incident served as a wake-up call that was only partly heeded. Japan invested in alternative sources, particularly in Australia, though remains heavily dependent on Chinese supplies. That September, the U.S. House passed the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act to subsidize the revival of the American rare earths industry, including reopening Mountain Pass, which resumed production in 2012 only to fall into bankruptcy three years later. Today, under the new ownership of MP Materials, it remains the only functioning American rare earth mine.</p>



<p>Crucially, however, not all rare earths are created equal. What are termed rare earths are in fact a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of 17 elements with overlapping but ultimately unique properties. Regarding permanent rare earth magnets for actuators, the most common element is neodymium, which can be sourced from Mountain Pass. The problem is that for actuators to work at high temperatures&mdash;like those found under a car&rsquo;s hood&mdash;the neodymium needs to be mixed with either dysprosium or terbium, distinct rare earth minerals which are not significantly present in the Mountain Pass ore body.</p>



<p>In fact, China controls practically 100% of global supply of dysprosium and terbium and added both to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/"  target="_blank">export controls</a> on April 4. Tellingly, Beijing didn&rsquo;t bother restricting sales of neodymium, cognizant of alternative sources&mdash;and the fact they are largely useless without their heat-resistant siblings.</p>



<p>So where can American firms source dysprosium and terbium&mdash;and fast?</p>



<hr/>



<p>At the Lynas rare earth mine in Mount Weld, Western Australia, yellow diggers scoop the tawny earth and dump it into soot-stained trucks. Following on-site concentration, the semi-refined ore is then taken on a four-hour drive to processing facilities in nearby Kalgoorlie, or loaded on ships to Malaysia, where in the seaside town of Kuantan Lynas operates the world&rsquo;s largest rare earth processing plant. Crucially, in May the Kuantan plant produced its first batch of dysprosium and is expecting its first terbium this month.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is an exciting achievement for Lynas and for manufacturers keen to secure a resilient supply of separated rare earths products,&rdquo; Amanda Lacaze, CEO and managing director of Lynas Rare Earths, tells TIME. &ldquo;We have stated our intention to meet the needs of the U.S. Defense Industrial Base on a priority basis.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a great start, but given the insatiable global appetite for rare earths, many more sources will ultimately be needed. And other options are years from fruition.</p>



<p>It was with great fanfare that Trump <a href="https://time.com/7282110/ukraine-minerals-deal/" >signed</a> a deal with Ukraine in March that ostensibly handed half the war-torn nation&rsquo;s future oil, gas, and mineral wealth&mdash;including rare earths&mdash;to the U.S. The only problem is that Ukraine may have abundant reserves of lithium and titanium, but it <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals"  target="_blank">doesn&rsquo;t actually have rare earths</a> in any sizable deposits worthy of exploitation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2207178869.jpg" alt="Mount Karachun Near The City Of Sloviansk In Donetsk Oblast" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>What about Greenland? Trump has repeatedly touted buying or even invading the semi-autonomous Danish province, citing its mineral wealth. In March, Vice President J.D. Vance led a U.S. delegation including National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to Greenland. But while Greenland does boast 18% of the world&rsquo;s total rare earth reserves, accessing them is extremely problematic, owing to freezing temperatures and a thick layer of silica. Chinese, American, and European prospectors have spent decades trying to figure out how to extract these resources without any success. Today, Greenland has no functioning rare earth mines.</p>



<p>Other options are more feasible. Brazil has the world&rsquo;s third largest reserves of rare earths and is aggressively exploring this space, while Saudi Arabia also boasts significant deposits and signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S. on critical minerals during Trump&rsquo;s visit in May. MP Materials and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s national mining company, Maaden, also <a href="https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Maaden-and-MP-Materials-Collaborate-to-Establish-Full-Value-Chain-for-Rare-Earth-Magnetics/default.aspx"  target="_blank">signed</a> a MoU to collaborate on establishing a rare earth supply chain in the Gulf state.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Japan&rsquo;s state-owned energy firm JOGMEC and gas firm Iwatani have <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/japans-jogmec-iwatani-to-invest-120-million-in-french-rare-earths-project/#:~:text=The%20$1.83%20billion%20all%2Dstock,Equinox%20from%20the%20current%20seven."  target="_blank">unveiled</a> plans to invest up to $120 million in a French rare earths refining project.</p>



<p>And with Africa boasting four of the top 10 nations for rare earth exploration last year&mdash;namely South Africa, Namibia, Uganda, and Malawi&mdash;the continent stands to play a huge role in future supply chains.</p>



<p>But there are also options closer to home. Other than Mountain Pass, Lynas has <a href="https://lynasrareearths.com/u-s-dod-strengthens-support-for-lynas-u-s-facility/"  target="_blank">secured</a> $258 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to build a heavy rare earth refinement facility in Seadrift, Texas. &ldquo;The U.S. facility has been designed with the capability to process feedstock from other sources as and when they become available and are qualified,&rdquo; says Lacaze.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NioCorp has the permits to build a rare earth processing facility at its Elk Creek Mine in Nebraska and is currently waiting on a $780 million financing agreement with the U.S. Export&ndash;Import Bank for the $1.2 billion project, which will take around three years to get online. Smith, the NioCorp CEO, says he is currently 2.5 steps through a four-step approval process, which if greenlighted will provide up to 1,500 jobs during construction followed by a 450-strong full-time crew. Although Smith predicts Elk Creek could service all Department of Defense dysprosium and terbium needs, he&rsquo;s under no illusions about the scale of the challenge.</p>



<p>&ldquo;One thing absolutely for sure is that NioCorp, by itself, is not the whole answer to the problem,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re rooting for anybody to be an additional part of the solution. We need to put all the parts together to really be formidable against China.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Unfortunately, simply seeding projects in friendly countries doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem. For one, China controls the separation and refining equipment market and placed export controls on those technologies in December 2023. Today, the rare earth refining industry is scrambling to reverse engineer Chinese technologies or innovate entirely new ones.</p>



<p>There is also the matter of expertise. Refining rare earths is &ldquo;a whole new art unto itself,&rdquo; says Smith. Heavy rare earth elements are extremely close to each other in terms of their atomic weights, making the process to separate each from the other at sufficient purity levels for commercial or military applications extremely taxing.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s chemical engineering involved, there&rsquo;s physics, there&rsquo;s kinetics,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;It takes a whole bunch of knowhow, practice, and art to get heavy rare earths into their final purified oxide form. As well as a big investment.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The cash injections needed keep on growing. Lynas&rsquo;s Texas project, for one, is currently stalled as the firm seeks more government funding on top of the nine figures already pledged. &ldquo;Following design changes to accommodate local permitting, additional CAPEX will be required, and Lynas is in discussion with the U.S. government with respect to this funding,&rdquo; says Lacaze.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1148483614.jpg" alt="Inside The Mountain Pass Mine As Rare Earths Face Trade War Threats" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>But even if all these new rare earth projects are realized across the globe, challenging Chinese dominance must still overcome its toughest obstacle: price.</p>



<p>China has spent decades building out massive capacity for rare earth minerals, so all other competitors operate at a huge disadvantage. &ldquo;The inside China price is used by outside China customers as a benchmark,&rdquo; says Lacaze. &ldquo;We have not observed any intent from the majority of non-Chinese consumers to pay a significant premium to the inside China price.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Moreover, China&rsquo;s massive processing capacity means it just opens the spigot whenever a potential competitor emerges to price them out of the market. The Chinese state has no problem eating any short-term losses to maintain key strategic levers over the global economy. It&rsquo;s a similar dynamic for many different minerals, including cobalt, nickel, and titanium. Today, neodymium oxide costs less than $60 per kilogram&mdash;around half its 2023 cost&mdash;and is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/450152/global-reo-neodymium-oxide-price-forecast/"  target="_blank">forecast</a> to get even cheaper.</p>



<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest challenges we face is that rare earth prices are very low,&rdquo; says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &ldquo;And a lot of that has been achieved through market manipulation by China increasing and increasing production.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The cost issue looks frankly impossible to solve. Other than technical challenges, refining rare earth minerals uses a huge amount of water. Back when China was first ramping up its rare earth industry, wastewater was just discharged into the nearest river, although environmental standards have tightened considerably in recent years. In the U.S. or other developed economies, wastewater must be evaporated in huge kilns to isolate and dispose of pollutants&mdash;though this is a very energy intensive and thus costly process. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not something that China has to do,&rdquo; shrugs Smith.</p>



<p>So, the big question is how American&mdash;or Saudi or African&mdash;rare earths can survive in such a cost-competitive marketplace. Various mechanisms have been considered: One is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp"  target="_blank">Contract for Difference</a> model, which is common in agriculture and says that if prices fall below a certain point the government will pay the difference. Another option is having the government serve as an <a href="https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/what-is-an-offtake-agreement/"  target="_blank">Offtaker of Last Resort</a>, agreeing to buy minerals at a certain price if nobody wants them on the open market.</p>



<p>However, &ldquo;in the U.S., at least in an era of <a href="https://time.com/7222251/doge-musk-federal-workers-government/" >DOGE</a>, putting in an indefinite OPEX subsidy is quite politically unpalatable,&rdquo; says Baskaran. &ldquo;But it is what China will do, so how do we compete against a country that&rsquo;s willing to inject fiscal support at any part of the supply chain to retain their dominance?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Another potential solution is one very close to Trump&rsquo;s heart: tariffs. By hiking levies on Chinese rare earths, the U.S. could strongarm firms to source from preferred friendly nations. But this essentially shifts the cost burden from government to businesses, undermining their global competitiveness with unknown ramifications down the line.</p>



<p>For Smith, tariffs are merely a stop-gap solution. &ldquo;The answer cannot be for President Trump to issue a tariff,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need to be competitive with or without tariffs by increasing our technology, improving our processes, using more robotics. But we must have a legitimate business at the end of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >Israel</a> launched a strike Monday on the headquarters of Iranian state television outlet IRIB, interrupting a live broadcast and sending debris and dust swirling through the studio during a newscast.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian regime&#8217;s propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of residents in the area,&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz said <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934643151655899471"  target="_blank">in a statement</a>. &ldquo;We will defeat the Iranian dictator everywhere.&rdquo;</p>



<p>During the live transmission, IRIB anchor Sahar Emami was speaking when a loud explosion was heard.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;This sound you heard, it is the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness,&rdquo; she said, before the screen behind her went black. Emami was seen leaving the set as the airstrike hit. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-strikes-iranian-state-tv-building/3600753"  target="_blank">IRIB Organization building</a> in Tehran&rsquo;s District 3, had been subject to an <a href="https://x.com/IDFFarsi/status/1934604000239767898"  target="_blank">IDF-issued evacuation</a> notice hours earlier.</p>



<p>A senior official at the state broadcaster responded, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-state-tv-resumes-broadcasting-after-israeli-strike-vows-not-to-be-silenced/"  target="_blank">stating</a>:&ldquo;The regime [Israel] was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong><em> <a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel Gets the War It Wanted</a></em></p>



<p>The bombing marked an escalation as the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day. </p>



<p>Iranian missile strikes earlier Monday killed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-missile-attacks-nuclear-news-06-16-2025-c98074e62ce5afd4c3f6d33edaffa069"  target="_blank">at least eight people</a> in Israel, authorities said, raising the country&#8217;s death toll to <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">at least 24</a>. Iranian officials meanwhile reported that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">at least 224 people</a> have been killed since the hostilities began.</p>



<p>Israeli military officials said their forces had achieved &ldquo;full aerial control above Tehran&rdquo; and claimed to have destroyed <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wbidaqxe"  target="_blank">approximately one-third</a> of Iran&rsquo;s surface-to-surface missile launchers.</p>



<p>In turn, Iranian state media claimed the country is preparing for &ldquo;the largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil.&rdquo;</p>



<p>At the G7 summit in Canada, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to open dialogue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it&#8217;s too late,&#8221; <a href="https://time.com/7294722/iran-israel-war-trump-strike/" >Trump said</a>.</p>

<p>Smoke and missiles have lit up the skies in Israel and Iran in a fierce standoff triggered by fears over <a href="https://time.com/7294133/iran-israel-nuclear-program-attack/" >Tehran&rsquo;s expanding nuclear program</a>.</p>



<p>Since June 13, hundreds of military strikes have been exchanged as the two nations remain locked in a conflict that shows no signs of abating. </p>



<p>The ongoing exchange of attacks has brought the death toll to at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">224 in Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">24</a> in Israel. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://time.com/7294186/israel-warns-tehran-will-burn-deadly-strikes-traded-nuclear-program/" >Benjamin Netanyahu</a> claimed Monday that military forces are &ldquo;striking regime targets&mdash;unlike Iran&rsquo;s criminal regime, which targets civilians.&rdquo; </p>



<p>In Tehran, many residents are fleeing to safer areas, while in Israel, air raid sirens continue to sound, urging citizens to seek shelter.</p>



<p>The violence has also resulted in significant damage to residential buildings, power grids, and oil refineries.</p>

<p>The timeline for a resolution remains unclear. President Donald Trump expressed support for a nuclear arms deal in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232"  target="_blank">an early Sunday post</a> on Truth Social, suggesting he could help broker an agreement. Trump affirmed his backing of Israel&rsquo;s defense and <a href="https://time.com/7294360/trump-warns-iran-bloody-conflict-israel-death-toll-rises/" >said</a> he hopes to keep the U.S. out of the broader Middle Eastern conflict for now, <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" >though reports indicate</a> some level of military coordination between Israel and the U.S.</p>

<p>He also warned Iran against retaliating against the U.S., <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">stating</a>, &ldquo;if we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-g7-tehran-evacuate.jpg" alt="CANADA-G7-SUMMIT-DIPLOMACY"/>



<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699514822488706"  target="_blank">asserted Tuesday</a> that there is now &ldquo;complete and total control of the skies over Iran,&rdquo; though he did not clarify whether he was referring to American or <a href="https://time.com/7294919/israel-air-supremacy-tehran-iran/" >Israeli military operations</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Truth Social. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured &lsquo;stuff.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The remark came as the President called for a &ldquo;real end&rdquo; to the conflict between <a href="https://time.com/7294609/iran-israel-war-pictures-strike/" >Israel and Iran</a>, now in its fifth day. </p>



<p>Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said the United States was &ldquo;looking at better than a cease-fire,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;An end, a real end, not a cease-fire&hellip; Or giving up entirely. It&rsquo;s certainly possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump also claimed that the U.S. is aware of the exact location of Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following reports of a recent proposal from Israel to assassinate him. </p>



<p>&#8220;We know exactly where the so-called &#8216;Supreme Leader&#8217; is hiding,&#8221; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699610769479275"  target="_blank">he posted Tuesday</a>. &#8220;He is an easy target, but is safe there &#8211; We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don&rsquo;t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-rejected-israeli-plan-kill-iran-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-sources/"  target="_blank">According to U.S. media citing unnamed officials</a>, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented the option to Trump during a call over the weekend.</p>



<p>In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu declined to confirm or deny the proposal.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There are so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I&rsquo;m not going to get into that,&rdquo; Netanyahu said. &ldquo;But I can tell you I think we do what we need to do. We will do what we need to do, and I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Civilian death toll rises</h2>



<p>Tensions between the two nations have escalated since <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >Israel&rsquo;s first attack on Iran</a> on Friday, with the civilian death toll mounting. </p>



<p>At least 452 people have been killed in Iran since Israeli strikes began, including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">224 civilians</a> and 109 military personnel, according to the <a href="https://www.en-hrana.org/the-fourth-day-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran-a-review-of-the-incidents/"  target="_blank">Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA).</a> Another 646 have been injured.</p>



<p>HRANA is one of the few independent groups tracking casualties inside Iran. Though banned by the government, it is frequently cited by international rights organizations and the U.N.</p>



<p>In Israel, officials say 24 people have been killed and more than 647 wounded in Iranian attacks <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">as of Tuesday</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">U.S. and Iran may meet this week, report says</h2>



<p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi may meet this week to discuss a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Iran, news outlet Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-witkoff-iran-nuclear-talks-ceasefire"  target="_blank">reported</a> on Monday night.</p>



<p>The meeting is not yet confirmed, but is part of Trump&rsquo;s effort to deescalate tensions between Israel and Iran while he faces pressure from Israel to <a href="https://time.com/7294500/israel-attack-iran-us-involvement-trump-netanyahu-khamenei/" >join the war</a>. </p>



<p>A U.S. official told Axios that a key bargaining chip for the U.S. is its military&rsquo;s ability, unlike Israel&rsquo;s, to bomb Iran&rsquo;s underground nuclear enrichment facility at Fordow.</p>



<p>Trump said at the G7 summit that his Administration is discussing the possibility of meeting with Iran and reiterated his position that a deal can be made. </p>



<p>The aim of the meeting will likely also involve reaching a nuclear deal, which has been the subject of protracted talks between the U.S. and Iran over the last two months. A scheduled round of negotiations over the past weekend was cancelled by Iran after the attack by Israel.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I think a deal will be signed,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://x.com/SkyNews/status/1934720414988546143"  target="_blank">told</a> reporters at the G7. &ldquo;I think Iran is foolish not to sign one.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump leaves G7 early as U.S. deploys &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; forces to Middle East</h2>



<p>Trump cut short his visit to the G7 summit on Monday amid worsening hostilities in the Middle East.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Much was accomplished [at the G7], but because of what&rsquo;s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State,&rdquo; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/1934755141082861736"  target="_blank">announced</a> on X.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-leaves-g7-early.jpg" alt="CANADA-G7-SUMMIT-DIPLOMACY" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The decision came shortly after Trump urged &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; to evacuate Tehran immediately, while the U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/16/us-military-israel-iran/"  target="_blank">deployed</a> more than a dozen aircraft to Europe to place them closer to the Middle East in case of the need to defend U.S. interests.</p>



<p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in a Monday <a href="https://x.com/SecDef/status/1934726498725810271"  target="_blank">statement</a> on X that &ldquo;additional capabilities&rdquo; have also been deployed to the Middle East. &ldquo;Protecting U.S. forces is our top priority and these deployments are intended to enhance our defensive posture in the region,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer rebutted the suggestion that the moves indicate that the U.S. has joined the war. &ldquo;American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,&rdquo; he <a href="https://x.com/Pfeiffer47/status/1934767323333714181"  target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are vigilant. We are prepared. We have messaged consistently from the beginning that we&rsquo;re in the region to defend our people and our assets,&rdquo; Hegseth <a href="https://x.com/DODResponse/status/1934773691537047871"  target="_blank">said</a> on Fox News on Monday.</p>



<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump urged Iran to pursue immediate talks with Israel to deescalate hostilities, warning that <a href="https://time.com/7294609/iran-israel-war-pictures-strike/" >continued conflict</a> could have dire consequences.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; Trump told reporters at the beginning of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G7 summit.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which were scheduled for Tuesday, were cancelled.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I have to be back, very important,&rdquo; Trump told reporters. &ldquo;You probably see what I see, and I have to be back as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump <a href="https://x.com/LawrenceBJones3/status/1934758790882120170"  target="_blank">reportedly asked</a> the National Security Council to convene at the White House Situation Room ahead of his return.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Iranian strikes hit Tel Aviv scientific and military research center</h2>



<p>A research institute in southern Tel Aviv is assessing the damage after an Iranian missile strike hit the facilities on Sunday.</p>



<p>Eran Segal, a Professor in the Computer Science Department at The Weizmann Institute of Science, <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/israeli-scientists-mourn-loss-destroyed-weizmann-institute"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">said that his team</a> has been transferring valuable samples from freezers at the institute, trying to preserve what they can amongst the wreckage.</p>



<p>Other researchers from The Weizmann Institute of Science shared images of severe damage to the facilities. Professor Eldad Thazor said that his lab has been completely destroyed.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We study heart regeneration and regenerative medicine. As such, we will regenerate, regrow and rebuild. The one thing that hasn&#8217;t gone is our motivation,&rdquo; he said&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/tzahore/status/1934698948037648674?s=46&amp;t=IV8KMN2S1o4Jt3KkL9I7ag" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">on social media</a>.</p>



<p>As well as medical research, <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/bina/news/weizmann-institute-science-and-elbit-systems-collaboration?utm_source=chatgpt.com"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the institute has also worked</a> with Elbit systems, an Israeli military manufacturer. Elbit regularly provides military systems to the IDF, including communication equipment provided as part of a <a href="https://www.elbitsystems.com/news/israel-mod-procures-advanced-communication-systems-elbit-systems-approximately-130m"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">$130M deal</a> in December.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Iranian state TV office hit in Israeli strike</h2>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=YQvKcMga autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>Israel attacked the offices of Iranian state TV Monday, interrupting a live IRIB broadcast and sending debris and dust through the studio.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian regime&#8217;s propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of residents in the area,&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934643151655899471"  target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will defeat the Iranian dictator everywhere,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>Anchor Sahar Emami is seen in video of the interrupted transmission speaking live, saying: &ldquo;This sound you heard, it is the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness,&rdquo; followed by a loud explosion and the screen behind her turning black.</p>



<p>Emami then leaves the studio set, as debris and dust fills the studio. Hours before the attack, the IDF issued <a href="https://x.com/IDFFarsi/status/1934604000239767898"  target="_blank">an evacuation notice</a> for Tehran&rsquo;s District 3, where the state television headquarters are located in the <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-strikes-iranian-state-tv-building/3600753"  target="_blank">IRIB Organization building</a>.</p>



<p>In response to the strike, a senior official at the state broadcaster <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-state-tv-resumes-broadcasting-after-israeli-strike-vows-not-to-be-silenced/"  target="_blank">has said</a>: &ldquo;The regime [Israel] was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Putin and Erdogan condemn Israeli actions against Iran</h2>



<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israeli military actions during a phone call on Monday, according to the Kremlin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/putin-erdogan-condemn-israeli-actions-against-iran-phone-call-kremlin-says-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">the Kremlin also said</a> in a statement.</p>



<p>Erdogan also warned that Israel&rsquo;s June 13 airstrikes have placed the region&rsquo;s security &ldquo;at grave risk,&rdquo; according to <a href="https://tass.com/world/1973793"  target="_blank">Russian state news agency TASS.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nuclear agency warns of radiological and chemical contamination inside Iran&rsquo;s main nuclear site</h2>



<p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned Monday of potential radiological and chemical contamination at Iran&rsquo;s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz following Israeli airstrikes.</p>



<p>Radiation levels outside the site remain normal, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-16-june-2025"  target="_blank">told an emergency session in Vienna</a>. However, he stressed that the agency lacks critical technical information to assess the full extent of the damage.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Amid these challenging and complex circumstances, it is crucial that the IAEA receives timely and regular technical information about the facilities and their respective sites,&rdquo; Grossi said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without this access to information, the IAEA &ldquo;cannot accurately assess the radiological conditions and potential impacts on the population and the environment and cannot provide the necessary assistance,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Electrical facilities at the Natanz plant have been seriously damaged <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/director-general-grossis-statement-to-unsc-on-situation-in-iran-13-june-2025"  target="_blank">according to the IAEA</a>, including the main power supply building and back up generators which have been destroyed. </p>



<p>The agency has also reported that strikes appear to have only impacted facilities above ground, but have not been able to verify any damage to underground areas of the plant.</p>

<p>Experts say that&rsquo;s what authorities in Hong Kong may be counting on, as they intensify a democratic crackdown in the semi-autonomous Chinese region, quietly building off of moves that began years ago to align the once-democratic stronghold with the more authoritarian government of Beijing.</p>



<p>On June 12, Hong Kong authorities <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200951.htm"  target="_blank">conducted</a> a joint operation with China&rsquo;s national security officials in the city, raiding the homes of six people and the office of an organization suspected of &ldquo;collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.&rdquo; Just days before, Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000697.htm"  target="_blank">warned</a> against downloading a &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; mobile video game deemed to be &ldquo;endangering national security.&rdquo; And on June 10, the city&rsquo;s leader, John Lee, <a href="https://sc.isd.gov.hk/TuniS/www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000389.htm"  target="_blank">said</a> Hong Kong will ramp up &ldquo;national security&rdquo; screenings of food and entertainment establishments.</p>



<p>Since the Chinese Central Government passed <a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" >a controversial law in 2020</a> in response to widespread <a href="https://time.com/5605920/hong-kong-protests/" >anti-establishment protests</a> the year before, Hong Kong has steadily transformed from a place known for freer expression to one that Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist focused on Asia, described last month as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fortifyrights.org/eas-inv-oped-2025-05-23/"  target="_blank">police state</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the law, which penalizes a swathe of actions deemed critical of Hong Kong and China, was passed, officials from both parties in the U.S. at the time saw it as an infringement on democratic rights, and the U.S. imposed sanctions to try to mitigate the effects.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, however, has said little about what&rsquo;s unfolding in Hong Kong. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1906755807963681144"  target="_blank">said in March</a> that &ldquo;Beijing has broken its promises to the people of Hong Kong&rdquo; amid the crackdowns, and on March 31, the State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-six-individuals-for-undermining-hong-kongs-autonomy/"  target="_blank">sanctioned</a> six individuals related to the erosion of freedom in Hong Kong, including national security officials and the city&rsquo;s former police commissioner.</p>



<p>But critics say the U.S. response seems to end there, and the latest wave of actions in June have not been addressed.</p>



<p>The turmoil around the globe may be proving helpful for Hong Kong to fasttrack its crackdown. Eric Yan-ho Lai, a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, tells TIME that &ldquo;the rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, has favoured the Hong Kong government to expand national security governance in the city.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Lai also said the latest developments show that Hong Kong officials have since shifted to &ldquo;executive-led&rdquo; regulatory approaches to quell dissent, rather than arrests en masse.</p>



<p>Under Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, U.S. policy has so far focused on China, with Hong Kong often lumped in with the mainland. For example, enhanced scrutiny of <a href="https://time.com/7289945/us-china-trump-rubio-international-student-visa-restrictions-trade-negotiations/" >Chinese students&rsquo; visas</a> also covered those from Hong Kong. Hong Kong was also included in U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7292207/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-timeline/" >tariffs on Chinese goods</a>.</p>



<p>Experts <a href="https://time.com/7174087/trump-second-term-foreign-policy-asia-approach/" >previously told TIME</a> that Trump&rsquo;s second-term Administration, in hopes of negotiating with China on priorities like trade, may avoid measures aimed at non-economic areas, such as China&rsquo;s domestic democratic and human-rights concerns, that could potentially ruffle Trump&rsquo;s relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore,&nbsp; tells TIME he thinks members of the Trump Administration like Rubio are &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of what&rsquo;s happening in Hong Kong but that the Administration is &ldquo;most focused&rdquo; at the moment on its own domestic issues.</p>



<p>On that front, Beijing may also benefit, observers have noted in recent days, as increasingly authoritarian-resembling moves by the Trump Administration, including <a href="https://time.com/7291978/los-angeles-immigration-protests-trump-national-guard-deployed-newsom-backlash/" >sending troops to quell protests in Los Angeles</a> earlier this month and <a href="https://time.com/7294323/trumps-military-parade-took-over-washington-as-anti-trump-no-kings-protests-dominated-everywhere-else/" >hosting a military parade</a> over the weekend, cast the U.S. as comparatively hypocritical and weak, according to Chinese media.<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3314508/setting-sun-chinese-media-contrasts-us-pageantry-and-violence-trumps-parade-day"  target="_blank">Said one state-run outlet</a> about Saturday&rsquo;s lackluster parade: &ldquo;Democracy is struggling in the mud.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As Alex Colville and David Bandurski of the China Media Project <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2025/06/16/a-trump-card-for-chinas-media/"  target="_blank">put it</a>: &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s assault on democratic norms is an unexpected gift for China&rsquo;s leaders, and one that may in the long term prove costlier than any trade war or diplomatic standoff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The U.S. has repeatedly denied involvement in <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >Israel&rsquo;s initial attack against Iran</a>&mdash;a position that Iran has disputed as missiles continue to fly between the two countries and the risk of further escalation looms should the world&rsquo;s biggest military be pulled into the fight. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>A number of reports, however, suggest that the U.S. may have played a greater role than has officially been admitted. </p>



<p>Unnamed U.S. officials told multiple news outlets on Sunday that President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we&rsquo;re not even talking about going after the political leadership,&rdquo; one official told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-vetoed-an-israeli-plan-kill-irans-supreme-leader-us-officials-say-2025-06-15/"  target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>Israel has denied such a plan, but the reported rejection by Trump would indicate some amount of coordination between the U.S. and Israel.</p>

<p>The conflict has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/"  target="_blank">killed hundreds</a> and wounded more than a thousand since Friday in Iran and killed <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">at least 24</a> and injured hundreds in Israel.</p>



<p>The attack on Iran came amid protracted talks between the U.S. and Iran centered around <a href="https://time.com/7294133/iran-israel-nuclear-program-attack/" >Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program</a>. </p>



<p>Trump has <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232"  target="_blank">emphasized</a> finding a diplomatic solution to the conflict, touting his self-professed ability to broker peace, but Iran and Israel have so far shrugged off international calls for deescalation as both sides launched new attacks early Monday.</p>



<p>Iran has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., too, while Trump has <a href="https://time.com/7294360/trump-warns-iran-bloody-conflict-israel-death-toll-rises/" >warned</a>: &ldquo;If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.&rdquo; </p>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=YQvKcMga autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about U.S. involvement so far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&ldquo;Nothing to do with the attack&rdquo;</h2>



<p>Israel launched its attacks, dubbed &ldquo;Operation Rising Lion,&rdquo; early Friday, targeting Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities as well as <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/" >military leaders and nuclear scientists</a> and promising that strikes &ldquo;will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat&rdquo; of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Iran launched <a href="https://time.com/7293839/iran-retaliation-israel-attack-what-to-know/" >retaliatory strikes</a> at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Friday evening and have continued to fire missiles at the country.</p>



<p>Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/15/solid-evidence-iran-says-us-bears-responsibility-for-israels-aggression"  target="_blank">said</a> Iran has &ldquo;solid evidence&rdquo; that the U.S. provided support for Israel&rsquo;s attacks. Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said in a <a href="https://x.com/IrnaEnglish/status/1933371705486950552"  target="_blank">statement</a> that the attacks &ldquo;could not have been carried out without coordination with and approval of the United States,&rdquo; adding that the U.S. will be &ldquo;held responsible for the dangerous consequences of Israel&rsquo;s adventurism.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The U.S. has denied any involvement in Israel&rsquo;s strikes, a position that the Trump Administration has repeated multiple times since Friday.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,&rdquo; Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a <a href="https://za.usembassy.gov/statement-from-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio/"  target="_blank">statement</a> released soon after the strikes started, describing the attack as &ldquo;unilateral action&rdquo; by Israel. Rubio admitted Israel had informed the Trump Administration of the attack, which both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-aware-israel-strikes-iran-beforehand-says-were-no-surprises"  target="_blank">reiterated</a>. The U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7293392/us-embassy-iraq-iran/" >evacuated</a> embassy staff from across the region the day before the attack last week.</p>



<p>In a post on Truth Social urging Iran to &ldquo;make a deal,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114675456780398208"  target="_blank">suggested</a> Friday that he was also aware of &ldquo;the next already planned attacks,&rdquo; which would be &ldquo;even more brutal.&rdquo; Later that day, when asked by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> if he was given a heads-up about the initial attacks by Israel, he suggested that description was an understatement, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/trump-to-wsj-u-s-was-aware-of-israel-s-plans-to-attack-iran-4613AzRhb9WHfBFytL8Y"  target="_blank">responding</a>: &ldquo;Heads-up? It wasn&rsquo;t a heads-up. It was, we know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But on Saturday night, following further strikes, Trump again <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501"  target="_blank">posted</a>: &ldquo;The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&ldquo;Clear U.S. green light&rdquo;</h2>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7293976/israel-iran-attack-war-hezbollah/" >Israel&rsquo;s attack</a> had been months in the making. Reports in May of <a href="https://time.com/7287313/iran-israel-strike-report-nuclear-us-trump-history-context-explainer/" >Israel&rsquo;s preparations to strike Iran</a> suggested that the Trump Administration would not assist Israel in such an operation, especially as Washington was in the midst of negotiating a nuclear agreement with Tehran.</p>



<p>But news outlet <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/13/how-israel-executed-strike-iran-nuclear"  target="_blank">Axios reported</a> Friday that Israeli officials said the strikes were in fact coordinated with the U.S., claiming that the Trump Administration publicly pretended to oppose an Israeli attack but gave Israel a &ldquo;clear U.S. green light&rdquo; in private.</p>



<p>According to the latest reports, the U.S. has even intervened to shape the attack. U.S. officials told Reuters, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-attack-43e3b1ce47d12477ae4533c941386b75"  target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/15/politics/us-military-trump-israel-iran"  target="_blank">CNN</a>, and others that Israel had informed the Trump Administration of a credible plan to assassinate Khamenei and that the White House waved Israel off the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri later denied those reports, <a href="https://x.com/Lazar_Berman/status/1845829551357587636"  target="_blank">calling</a> them &ldquo;fake.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I&rsquo;m not going to get into that,&rdquo; Netanyahu said when asked about it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD4ZBIWpmKg"  target="_blank">Fox News</a> on Sunday. &ldquo;But I can tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The unclear messaging about the extent of U.S. involvement, however, could reflect mixed priorities between the U.S. and Israel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and an expert on U.S.-Iran relations, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5432480/israel-iran-war-trump"  target="_blank">told</a> NPR that &ldquo;clearly there had been coordination and some form of a green light&rdquo; by the Trump Administration for the Israeli strikes.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Trump is making a major gamble here, thinking that this actually will soften the Iranian position and make them capitulate,&rdquo; Parsi added. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t, what are his options? And this is where I think the Israelis are hoping that the Iranians will not capitulate and that will force the United States into the war.&rdquo;</p>
