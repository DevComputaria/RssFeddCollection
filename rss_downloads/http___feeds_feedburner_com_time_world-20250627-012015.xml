<p>By right of his birth, the immigration officials should have prostrated themselves before Juthavachara Vivacharawongse, eyes glued to the sunbaked earth, before offering jasmine garlands and shepherding him toward a waiting limousine. Instead, Juthavachara, who goes by the anglicized name Max, and his younger brother Vatchrawee, were ushered into a dingy interrogation room at the Thai-Malay border on May 28 and politely asked for their U.S. passports. It was a jarring moment for two sons of Thailand&rsquo;s king&mdash;estranged nobles returning to their homeland after decades in exile.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>After 45 minutes, a visibly uncomfortable official issued the verdict: the brothers were refused entry to Thailand, the country where their father reigns as King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Rama X of the Chakri Dynasty, the world&rsquo;s wealthiest monarch with a fortune estimated at some $60 billion. The rejection left Max &ldquo;physically and mentally crushed,&rdquo; he tells TIME in an exclusive interview. &ldquo;Because I&#8217;ve missed my homeland every day of my life, and I&#8217;ve always dreamed of going back.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Aside from a fleeting 12-hour visit in January, during which the brothers were detained, interrogated, and harassed by security officials wherever they went, this would have been the first time they had set foot on Thai soil since being banished by their father in 1996, along with their mother and two other brothers, following their parents&rsquo; high-profile divorce. </p>



<p>The heartbreak at the border spurred Max, 45, and Vatchrawee, 40, to pen a Facebook<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19EBFtoTqN/"  target="_blank"> post</a> that pinned blame on &ldquo;a small yet powerful group of individuals, seeking to preserve their influence within the monarchy, legal system, and political sphere.&rdquo; Max returned to his life as an aerospace engineer living in downtown San Diego, where his American wife was born and they recently moved with their three children to be closer to her family. But he agreed to speak exclusively to TIME about his family&rsquo;s ordeal since their banishment and his burning desire for reconciliation.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I want to get word to my father that I want to go back to live and to work,&rdquo; Max said in a Zoom interview. &ldquo;I have no other ambition other than to go back and be his loyal subject. But unfortunately, there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding that has prevented us from entering the country.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That misunderstanding has only metastasized in recent days. In August 2023, another brother, Vacharaesorn, 44, shocked the nation by suddenly returning to Thailand, the first time any of the Vivacharawongse family had visited Thailand for nearly three decades. He visited schools, made merit at temples, and lent his support to humanitarian projects, such as building houses for flood victims. He rode Bangkok&rsquo;s BTS Skytrain and gushed that it was cleaner than the New York subway. In late May, he shaved his head and donned the saffron robes of a Buddhist monk, as is common for royalty to demonstrate piety. Max&rsquo;s thwarted trip was ostensibly to offer support in this new endeavor.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We were all novice monks when we were still in the palace, as every young male member of the royal family had to do,&rdquo; Vacharaesorn told TIME last week. &ldquo;And I&#8217;m the first sibling to become an adult monk in Thailand for our family. So this was a very big deal for us, and we were all looking forward to celebrating together.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-story-showcase"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/thailand-king-sons-banishment-04.jpg" alt="Vatchrawee after being ordained as a monk during the Vesak Day celebration at Wat Pariwas in Bangkok, Thailand on May 11, 2025."/><img decoding="async" src="" alt="Secondary image"/></figure>



<p>However, on June 23, Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s stay in Thailand was abruptly curtailed. Scores of Thai security officials swooped on Wat Pariwat Ratchasongkram, a picturesque temple where Vacharaesorn was staying perched on the bank of Bangkok&rsquo;s Chao Phraya river, and detained him. After a quick stop at his home to pick up his belongings, Vacharaesorn was escorted to Suvarnabhumi International Airport and ordered on a flight to New York City, accompanied onto American soil by Thai security officials, who handed him straight to State Department representatives. Another brother, Chakriwat, would be deported from Thailand the following day, Vacharaesorn was told, although his location is currently unknown. All four are U.S. citizens. &ldquo;The officer who came for Vach informed him that they don&rsquo;t want any Vivacharawongse in the country,&rdquo; says Max, using a nickname for his brother.</p>



<p>TIME requested comment from Thailand&rsquo;s Royal Household Bureau regarding the reasons for Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s deportation and the Vivacharawongse family&rsquo;s status in Thailand but has not received a response. Thailand&rsquo;s Immigration Police has not responded to similar inquiries. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok declined to comment since they &ldquo;do not share information with the media about private U.S. citizens absent their written consent.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Why the Vivacharawongse brothers were exiled and partially rehabilitated only to be excommunicated once again lies at the core of a succession crisis that is roiling Thailand&rsquo;s royal household just as younger citizens are demanding reform of the institution. Although King Maha Vajiralongkorn has seven children, only three have royal titles, and none have been identified as heir. &ldquo;If no one really understands what&#8217;s going on, it&rsquo;s a source of instability, and it&rsquo;s a source of doubts,&rdquo; says Paul Handley, a journalist and author of The King Never Smiles, an unofficial biography of King Bhumibol that has been banned in Thailand.</p>



<p>Thailand is America&rsquo;s oldest ally in Asia whose revered palace historically served as a pillar of conservatism and permanence, as well as a bulwark against the communist fervor engulfing its Southeast Asian neighbors. Yet in the post-Cold War era, many young Thais feel alienated by the institution&rsquo;s opaque, hierarchical structures, and desire more accountability.</p>



<p>In 2020, unprecedented public protests erupted across Thailand that shattered taboos by openly calling for royal reform. Ten listed demands included permitting criticism of the King, properly accounting for the crown&rsquo;s finances, banning the sovereign from expressing political opinions, and prohibiting the monarchy from endorsing coups. In rare public comments around the time, King Vajiralongkorn called Thailand &ldquo;the land of compromise&rdquo; and said &ldquo;we love them all the same&rdquo; of the demonstrators.</p>



<p>Still, the lack of a clear succession plan is a cause of great anxiety in a country where the monarch has long served as a bastion of stability. The nation&rsquo;s 2014 <a href="https://time.com/108719/thai-army-declares-military-coup/" >coup d&rsquo;etat </a>was commonly ascribed to a desire by the nation&rsquo;s elites to micromanage the transition to King Vajiralongkorn. Yet he will turn 73 next month and nobody has a clue what the future of this paramount institution looks like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although primogeniture would make Max first in line for the throne, he currently has no royal titles, and Thailand&rsquo;s constitution excludes any potential heir with a foreign spouse. He insists that he and his brothers only want to be reunited with their homeland to live a simple life as regular folk. Yet forces are conspiring to ensure this never happens.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand why this is such a problem,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;It hurts me even more to think that I don&#8217;t believe I did anything wrong in my life, and yet I feel like I&#8217;m being punished for things that I did not do.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>It is, of course, a sadly common sentiment among the progeny of broken homes, though the fallout from Max&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; split was anything but typical. King Vajiralongkorn inherited the throne following the death of his revered father, <a href="https://time.com/4043989/thailand-king-dead-obituary-bhumibol-adulyadej/" >King Bhumibol Adulyadej</a>, who was the world&rsquo;s longest-reigning monarch when he passed in 2016. The only son among Bhumibol&rsquo;s four children, then Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, a former Royal Air Force pilot, was famed for his sybaritic lifestyle, spending much of his time in Germany, and has been married four times.</p>



<p>In a 1981 interview with the Dallas Times Herald during an American tour, Vajiralongkorn&rsquo;s mother, Queen Sirikit,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/01/23/thais-ban-asian-wall-street-journal-for-story-critical-of-monarch/ab6cbf0c-3282-46eb-a30f-f488f5c9da21/"  target="_blank"> said</a>: &ldquo;I have to be very frank. My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan. He is a good student, a good boy, but women find him interesting, and he finds women even more interesting. So his family life is not so smooth.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Vajiralongkorn&rsquo;s first wife bore him a daughter, Princess Bajrakitiyabha, but they divorced in 1991. His second wife, actress and dancer Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, gave birth to four sons and a daughter: Max, the eldest, followed by Vacharaesorn, Chakriwat, Vatchrawee, and Princess Sirivannavari.</p>



<p>The siblings grew up in the lap of luxury, dressed in the finest silks, with doting courtiers catering to their every whim. Though life wasn&rsquo;t always easy. When Max was young and living in the palace, the royal garage was his refuge, where he could escape domestic strife by clambering through dozens of luxury and vintage cars. &ldquo;Because there were a lot of unhappy times.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Vajiralongkorn divorced their mother in 1996 after accusing her of being unfaithful, stripping her and their sons of their titles and forbidding their return to Thailand. The family were living in the U.K., where the eldest two boys attended the prestigious Harrow private school, when the Thai Ambassador suddenly appeared and demanded they relinquish their diplomatic passports. Instead, ordinary ones were issued valid for just one year. Without her mother&rsquo;s knowledge, Princess Sirivannavari was spirited away to Thailand to live with her father. &ldquo;My mother got on the phone with His Majesty and said, &lsquo;Okay, you already have the girl. Do you want the boys as well?&rsquo;&rdquo; recalls Max. &ldquo;According to my mother, he said, &lsquo;Not at this time.&rsquo;&rdquo; The brothers have not seen their sister since.</p>



<p>Cast out from their homeland, Sujarinee and her sons moved to the U.S. as political refugees, settling in central Florida. &ldquo;I&#8217;m a diehard Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan,&rdquo; laughs Max. Sujarinee was the quintessential &ldquo;tiger mom,&rdquo; says Max, and ruled the household with an iron fist. &ldquo;She&#8217;s a very, very tough woman, and she pushed us extremely hard from a very young age. Education was extremely important. She said, &lsquo;just because you are not in Thailand doesn&#8217;t mean you have to lower yourself to the standards of commoner.&rsquo;&rdquo; Three brothers have law degrees; Chakriwat is a medical doctor.</p>



<p>Every year, the brothers would write a letter to their father on his birthday, as well as to mark important family events such as graduations, appraising him of their health and progress. No reply ever arrived. On occasions, the family would post public statements expressing their devotion and desire to return to Thailand. Early in their banishment, when the pain was still raw, the tenor was rebukeful. In 1998, a letter co-signed by the brothers <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/thailand-s-new-king-neglected-sons-and-forced-wife-into-exile-ggtwzr6ls#:~:text=The%20letter%2C%20verified%20by%20The%20Times%2C%20is,of%20us%2C%E2%80%9D%20when%20he%20was%20crown%20prince."  target="_blank">accused</a> their father of &ldquo;trying to erase memories of us,&rdquo; saying that he never loved their mother and would force them outside of their house &ldquo;every time he found another woman.&rdquo; Asked about this missive, Max says early letters tended to be drafted by their mother and didn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect the sons&rsquo; true sentiments.</p>



<p>In 2003, the boys heard that their father was to visit the U.S., so they turned up unannounced at the Thai Consulate in Chicago to doorstop him. The 30-minute meeting, during which Max and his three brothers sat on the floor per royal protocol, was &ldquo;standoffish,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t quite treat me as his child.&rdquo; Still, the then-Crown Prince enquired after the brothers&rsquo; health, education, and interests. &ldquo;Then he says, &lsquo;hey, you kids didn&#8217;t do anything wrong,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalls Max. &ldquo;&rsquo;If you ever want to come back to Thailand, nobody&rsquo;s going to stop you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Max now regrets that the brothers didn&rsquo;t immediately seize that invitation, though he notes they were still young and didn&rsquo;t want to abandon their mother, who was still patently unwelcome. Over time, the brothers came to terms with their exile, different as it was from the pampering of the palace. Max tried to put Thailand out of his mind and immerse himself in American life. &ldquo;At the time, all anybody could ever talk about was Thailand, Thailand, Thailand,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;I felt like it was holding us back. So I tried to go to school, get a job, move away from the family a little bit, and get my life going.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For nearly three decades, that&rsquo;s exactly what the family did. The brothers focused on school, worked casual jobs, and graduated college. As a young man, Vacharaesorn hawked hot dogs at sporting events and sold vacuums door-to-door.</p>



<p>In 2013, Max married an American woman, Riya Gough, and the couple have a son and two daughters. When not traveling for work, he plays pickleball, shops at Costco, and drives his kids to soccer practice in his custom BMW, which he sometimes races at the track. Thailand faded into the background.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-story-showcase"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/thailand-king-sons-banishment-03.jpg" alt="Sons of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Vacharaesorn"/><img decoding="async" src="" alt="Secondary image"/></figure>



<p>That all changed in August 2023, when Vacharaesorn suddenly returned to the Kingdom. &ldquo;I literally found out he was in Thailand through the media,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;He did not consult with me, my mother, or anybody in our family before going.&rdquo; It was a lightning bolt that left Max &ldquo;hurt and then somewhat angry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;because I thought that when it comes to Thailand, we&#8217;re all in it together.&rdquo;</p>



<p>However, Max softened after it emerged that Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s return had been generally well-received: &ldquo;I saw that he was making headway.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s return to Thailand spoke to a succession crisis that is roiling the nation of 70 million. Although King Vajiralongkorn was named heir aged 20, he still has not named his own successor. The presumed favorite had been Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the daughter of his first wife, but she collapsed while training her dogs in December 2022 and has been in a coma ever since. Hopes of a recovery are slim.</p>



<p>The King also has a son by his third wife, Prince Dipangkorn, although he is understood to have learning difficulties that could impede his ability to fulsomely discharge his royal duties. With few viable alternatives, Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s prodigal return has been seen by analysts as an attempt to road-test his suitability for the role.</p>



<p>However, after a few months, the tone soured. It emerged that Vacharaesorn had married an American woman, Elisa Garafano, and the couple have two daughters, which would bar him from consideration, just like Max. Although Vacharaesorn has steadfastly denied any desire for the throne, his desperate scrambling to explain that he was getting a divorce appeared to betray his furtive ambitions.</p>



<p>The perception among analysts was that Vacharaesorn was striving to thread the needle as a compromise candidate for succession, one who would appeal to progressives as a worldly, modernizing force, while still bearing blood blue enough to avoid alienating staunch royalists. But he may have misjudged just how precarious that tightrope had become, as the future of the institution was thrust to the center of political discourse.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Move Forward, a political party that openly campaigned on curbing the monarchy&rsquo;s powers, <a href="https://time.com/6279758/thailand-elections-move-forward-party-pheu-thai/" >won</a> the most seats in Thailand&#8217;s general elections but was <a href="https://time.com/6310002/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-move-forward-interview-profile/" >blocked</a> from forming a government by the military-appointed Senate. The party&rsquo;s subsequent disbandment by the Constitutional Court last August added grist to the perception among Move Forward&rsquo;s predominantly young voters that the nation&rsquo;s elites are conspiring to expunge their democratic will.</p>



<p>Vacharaesorn appeared to align himself with reformers with veiled criticism of Thailand&rsquo;s draconian l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; royal defamation law, known as Article 112, which is the bedrock on which royal power is built. Under it, anyone who defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, heir apparent, or regent faces three to 15 years in prison. Critics argue that far from protecting the dignity of the monarch, the law has been co-opted to silence all dissent.</p>



<p>At least 276 people, including 20 under the age of 18, were charged under Article 112 in the four years until November, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Last June, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and is father to current <a href="https://time.com/6271855/thailand-paetongtarn-shinawatra-election-interview/" >Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra</a>, was<a href="https://apnews.com/article/thailand-thaksin-lese-majeste-srettha-move-forward-a3b4bfee63f4ed547fffe2ff153fd0b4"  target="_blank"> indicted</a> for l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; for an interview he gave nearly a decade ago. &ldquo;Article 112 prosecutions are becoming more and more aggressive,&rdquo; says Paul Chambers, a renowned American expert on Thailand, who fled the country in May following a l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; charge.</p>



<p>In his recent Facebook post, Max lamented how his family had been harassed &ldquo;using surveillance, threats, and abuse of Article 112.&rdquo; But asked by TIME to elaborate, he pointedly declines. &ldquo;Charlie, I&#8217;m going to stay away from that one,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the palace&rsquo;s prerogative how that law is utilized.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/thailand-king-sons-banishment-05.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Regarding Article 112, it&rsquo;s possible Vacharaesorn flew close to the sun. In September 2023, a month following his initial return to Thailand, he attended an exhibition titled Faces of Victims of 112 at New York&rsquo;s Columbia University curated by Thai dissident Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a prominent academic who himself faces l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; charges. Afterwards, Vacharaesorn posted on Facebook that &ldquo;I love and hold my loyalty to the monarchy, but I believe that &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; is better than &lsquo;not knowing,&rsquo; and each individual has their own opinion which is derived from their own experiences.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s efforts to find the middle ground between reformists and royalists may have simply alienated both camps. His cause certainly hasn&rsquo;t been helped by several missteps. Other than the secret American family, it<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/prodigal-thai-prince-agrees-pay-182442803.html"  target="_blank"> emerged</a> that he left the U.S. with $94,767.88 in credit card debt, which he later agreed to pay back. After arriving in Thailand, he set up a legal consulting firm, VVV Group, to help foreign companies come to Thailand, and has been working with brands from Chinese EV firm Zeekr to Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg&rsquo;s tequila label.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The VVV Group website originally listed its chairman as &ldquo;Prince Vacharaesorn,&rdquo; despite his having been stripped of royal titles, but he has since removed the honorific. Still, the perception for many was that Vacharaesorn was attempting to cash in on his royal connections. He also reportedly had close contact with Thaksin, the former prime minister whose populist adulation has made him anathema to royalists. &ldquo;I think somehow he met up with the wrong people,&rdquo; says Pavin. &ldquo;And this encouraged rightwing royalists to go after him.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Max still insists his father remains unaware he was blocked from returning to Thailand, nor of Vacharaesorn&rsquo;s forced departure, believing instead that some shadowy clique is working against his family to protect their own interests. &ldquo;His Majesty has no idea that I&#8217;m trying to get back in. I sincerely believe that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He would welcome me with open arms. Things would never be back the way they were, but he would definitely not tell me to go away.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Max suspects that a palace faction has been conspiring to temper any influence his family might generate, fearful that more returning brothers might form a stronger alternative power source that would be more difficult to tame. They would presumably be figures who are close to Prince Dipangkorn and would prefer him to take the throne. &ldquo;This is a zero sum game for them,&rdquo; says Pavin.</p>



<p>Some have suggested it could even be the brothers&rsquo; estranged sister, Princess Sirivannavari, who having toiled by her father&rsquo;s side for decades now objects to being sidelined by her returning kin. &ldquo;That is certainly the rumor that I&#8217;ve heard,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;But I don&#8217;t know if I could ever substantiate it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The opacity of the palace means no outsiders can know for sure. But the actions of King Vajiralongkorn following his rise to the apogee of Thai society don&rsquo;t suggest a monarch wanting for control.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-story-showcase"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/thailand-king-sons-banishment-01.jpg" alt="Commuters in Bangkok as Thai Court Ousts PM After Finding Him Guilty in Ethics Case"/><img decoding="async" src="" alt="Secondary image"/></figure>



<p>Since taking power, King Vajiralongkorn has taken personal command of the Crown Property Bureau, which handles the estimated $60 billion royal fortune, and brought several influential state offices under his direct supervision. In 2017, he ordered the transfer of two army units&mdash;the Bangkok-based 1st and 11th Infantry Regiments&mdash;from the military chain of command to the Royal Security Command under his direct supervision. The following year he established a new elite faction of the Thai Army&mdash;known as kho daeng, or red collar&mdash;whose members the palace nominates and from whom top leadership posts must be picked, including the Army Commander, Supreme Commander, and the Commander of the First Army Area, which covers central Thailand including Bangkok and has historically staged several coups. In addition, more than 1,600 police have been assigned to protect the King and his family.</p>



<p>Also in 2017, King Vajiralongkorn changed the national constitution to allow him to rule from abroad. Months later he dismissed or reassigned 96 palace staff on charges such as being &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; or &ldquo;arrogant,&rdquo; according to official royal proclamations, and later dismissed six palace officials for &ldquo;extremely evil&rdquo; conduct. When, in 2019, Vajiralongkorn&rsquo;s oldest sister Princess Ubolratana announced her candidacy for Prime Minister, Vajiralongkorn quickly blocked her, saying it would &ldquo;defy the nation&#8217;s culture.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In July 2019, King Vajiralongkorn designated Sineenatha Wongvajirapakdi as his official consort&shy;&mdash;rekindling a position that hadn&rsquo;t been seen for almost a century&mdash;only to strip her of her title and rank three months later. After she disappeared for 10 months, Sineenatha<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53994198"  target="_blank"> reemerged</a> in August 2020 suddenly <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/asia/thai-royal-consort-intl-hnk"  target="_blank">restored</a> to her former position as &ldquo;untainted,&rdquo; though she briefly disappeared from public view again in late 2021. Today, other than his queen and official consort, Vajiralongkorn has increasingly been seen with two other minor consorts, who have even been charged with royal duties in his absence.</p>



<p>In fact, the line of succession is the only aspect of palace life that King Vajiralongkorn has yet to exert a firm hand over&mdash;but it is the one that threatens to be most destabilizing. &ldquo;It&#8217;s the king&rsquo;s prerogative; it&#8217;s the palace&rsquo;s prerogative,&rdquo; shrugs Max of the succession. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t care because that is not my intent in life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The bottom line is that I love and respect His Majesty and want nothing more than to literally kiss his feet again. I just want to make people around him understand that there is absolutely no danger of any kind. I don&#8217;t want anything. I respect the institution and just love my homeland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Does his American family feel the same way? Max breaks into a weary grin. He reveals that he recently overheard a young friend of his 10-year-old son asking him what it was like being a part of a royal family. &ldquo;My son looked at his friend and says, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s crazy. There&rsquo;s nothing good about it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Monday, after Iran <a href="https://time.com/7296830/iran-qatar-air-base-trump/" >targeted the largest U.S. military base in Qatar</a> in a choreographed response to the <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >American bombing</a> of its nuclear facilities, President Donald Trump briskly dismissed Tehran&rsquo;s attack and <a href="https://time.com/7297049/iran-israel-ceasefire-trump/" >announced a ceasefire</a>.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>In the short term, the U.S. leader&rsquo;s declaration and subsequent <a href="https://time.com/7297315/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump-f-bomb/" >lashing out</a> against ceasefire violations might have ended the recent war between the regional rivals&mdash;but over the long term, the future of the conflict between Tehran and Tel Aviv depends on how the various parties manage what remains a brittle peace.</p>



<p>It is clear that, when Trump announced the ceasefire, Iran and Israel were ready to stop fighting. Israel&rsquo;s military success was undisputed; it had assassinated scores of Iranian military leaders, damaged several Iranian nuclear facilities and missile sites, and dominated Iranian skies. Yet it was also incomplete, in terms of Israel&rsquo;s stated goal of destroying the Iranian nuclear program; U.S. bombings pushed the program back, but reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/iran-nuclear-sites.html"  target="_blank">only by a few months</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other side, although bruised and bloodied, Iran could insist on being unbowed, on holding its own with enough of its missiles penetrating the Iron Dome and other Israeli air defense systems to compel Tel Aviv and the United States to seek a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet this tenuous pause in fighting does not lay the foundations of peace. Israel has already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685af7b98f08baa326f708ec#block-685af7b98f08baa326f708ec"  target="_blank">said</a> it will strike Iran again if it resumes its nuclear efforts. And unless there is a new comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the United States, Tehran is likely to seek to reassemble its nuclear program. That sets the stage for another confrontation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It won&rsquo;t happen immediately, of course. Iran needs to introspect upon the <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/how-iran-lost"  target="_blank">magnitude of its losses</a>, address its immense intelligence vulnerabilities, regroup its battered military apparatus after the spate of assassinations, and more generally rebuild its defenses. Israel, meanwhile, needs to rebuild and improve its air defenses which <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iron-dome-israel-iran-missiles-failing-tel-aviv-b2773584.html"  target="_blank">failed to prevent Iranian missiles</a> from striking strategic and civilian targets.</p>



<p>None of this, however, would stop Israel from continuing to launch lower-level attacks on Iran despite the ceasefire&mdash;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/7/israel-warns-of-more-attacks-on-lebanon-if-hezbollah-not-disarmed"  target="_blank">applying the same strategy</a> it has used in Lebanon despite its ceasefire with Hezbollah. Such attacks would elicit limited retaliation, as for now Iran&rsquo;s focus is likely to be on recovering from the recent war. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The long road to a lasting peace</h2>



<p>Further out, the question is: how do we go from the events of the past few weeks to real stability, not another return to war? How, in other words, does stability return to the region? </p>



<p>The answer hinges on two major factors&mdash;one inside Iran, and the other to do with diplomacy between the U.S. and Tehran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Domestically, beyond replenishing and rebuilding its military capacity, for there to be stablity in the Middle East, Iran has to address its greatest vulnerability: an angry population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iranians <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/14/the-protests-inside-irans-girls-schools"  target="_blank">have been at odds</a> with the country&rsquo;s leadership for some time. Economic hardship and isolation have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/24/iran-tehran-economy-trump-nuclear-negotiations/"  target="_blank">taken a toll</a>, and an increasingly large number of Iranian citizens no longer subscribe to the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/iran-secular-shift-gamaan.html"  target="_blank">revolutionary values</a> or support its foreign policy, which they blame for the country&rsquo;s isolation and economic woes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more ambiguously stated objective of Israel and the United States during the war was to incite the Iranians to rebel and topple the Islamic Republic. Iranians did no such thing. Yet in the coming days, domestic popular anger at Israeli aggression and the consequent material and psychological loss that Iranians have suffered is likely to lead to serious questioning of the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s policies.</p>



<p>After all, Iranians are patriotic but they also crave peace, security, and economic prosperity. Israeli attacks killed <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/06/iran-un-fact-finding-mission-special-rapporteur-call-civilian-protection-and"  target="_blank">hundreds of civilians</a> and injured thousands more, and destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and civilian infrastructure, including oil refineries which have led to fuel shortages. The expected conversation and contestation between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic and the response of the regime will be important in determining how Tehran manages the ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond Iran, the ceasefire also presents a test for President Trump. He took a risk by getting the U.S. involved in the attack on Iran. As we have already seen, unease about the U.S. getting dragged into another brutal, expensive, and potentially long war in the Middle East created factures within his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/22/iran-attack-maga-reaction-trump"  target="_blank">MAGA movement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, with the ceasefire, President Trump has a direct stake in ensuring that the peace holds. To make it last, he needs to effectively manage Israel&rsquo;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who might see benefits in breaking the ceasefire to further establish military dominance over Tehran. It is also possible that he might break it to handicap any renewed diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Iran over the latter&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that is precisely what the U.S. must do now to create a pathway for a durable peace: work towards resuming nuclear talks with Tehran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after this war, Iran still possesses its stockpile of <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/three-things-will-determine-irans-nuclear-future-fordow-just-one-them#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20IAEA%2C%20Iran,first%2025%20kg%20of%20weapons%2D"  target="_blank">400 kilograms</a> of highly enriched Uranium that, if still intact, could be used to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, according to <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/uscentcom_posture_statement_2025.pdf"  target="_blank">U.S. military</a> estimates. And it retains the expertise to rebuild its nuclear program. The speed at which Iran could move toward weaponization&mdash;if it makes that decision&mdash;depends on how much of its highly enriched uranium survived the American and Israeli bombing of nuclear sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn that, the United States has to ensure ongoing access to nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors ( the Iranian parliament has moved a bill to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-parliament-committee-approves-general-plan-suspend-cooperation-with-iaea-2025-06-23/"  target="_blank">suspend cooperation</a> with the IAEA). All this would have to be part of a nuclear deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iran has been clearly weakened by this war but that won&rsquo;t make its nuclear diplomacy with the United States straightforward or easy; it also understands that President Trump has a stake in maintaining the ceasefire and ensuring that there isn&rsquo;t a resumption of a war that could easily spiral into a wider regional conflagration, exacting grave political costs for all involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, President Trump might now have to consider incentives other than coercion and the threat of further bombing Iranian nuclear sites. </p>



<p>This might mean offering Iran greater economic relief, giving it guarantees that the U.S. will not seek or support regime change, and provide a security guarantee against future Israeli attacks. Ultimately, the Iranians do not trust the U.S. leader. He walked away from the 2015 nuclear deal and allowed Israel to attack Iran while he was still negotiating a nuclear deal with Tehran. So the bar for him to win their trust is very high.</p>



<p>This fraught history is bound to make renewed nuclear negotiations more difficult. Still, Iran needs to address its economic challenges, and Trump could offer the incentive of sanctions relief, guarantee that it would happen quickly, and won&rsquo;t be easily reversed. And Trump too needs a deal to avoid the risk of entering the United States into yet another war. Successful nuclear diplomacy&mdash;hard as it might be&mdash;is still possible, and remains the best option for both Iran and the United States. </p>

<p>Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that Iran would respond to any further U.S. attacks by <a href="https://time.com/7296830/iran-qatar-air-base-trump/" >targeting American military bases</a> in the Middle East, while declaring what he described as a &#8220;total victory&#8221; over Israel. </p>



<p>&ldquo;The Islamic Republic slapped America in the face. It attacked one of the important American bases in the region,&rdquo; Khamenei said during his first televised remarks since <a href="https://time.com/7297049/iran-israel-ceasefire-trump/" >a ceasefire was reached</a> to end the 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>On Monday, Tehran launched 19 ballistic missiles at Al Udeid Air Base, a <a href="https://time.com/7296830/iran-qatar-air-base-trump/" >U.S. airbase in Qatar</a>, in response to an American attack on three nuclear program sites inside Iran. All but one of the missiles were intercepted by air defenses, and no American or Qatari personnel were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/al-udeid-air-base-military-qatar-iran-501e9e64e80480ef3aa4ee43c1243235"  target="_blank">reported injured</a> in the attack.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Such an action can be repeated in the future too. Should any aggression occur, the enemy will definitely pay a heavy price,&rdquo; the Ayatollah <a href="https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/1938189238324941169"  target="_blank">warned</a>, adding that Iran has &ldquo;access to key U.S. centers in the region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Iranian strike followed a major U.S. military operation <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >on June 21</a>, in which American forces  targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities. President Donald Trump later claimed the attacks <a href="https://time.com/7297698/nato-2025-summit-trump-iran-ukraine-defense-topics/" >&ldquo;obliterated&rdquo; </a>Iran&rsquo;s nuclear capability. </p>



<p>However, leaked U.S. intelligence suggests that the damage to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program may not be as severe as Trump has alluded. CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday that the sites had been &ldquo;severely damaged&rdquo; by the strikes, short of the damage described by the President.</p>



<p>Khamenei also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-26-25-intl-hnk#cmcd8j2kc001f3b6nb2hue1r7"  target="_blank">criticized</a> President Trump&rsquo;s call for the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s &ldquo;unconditional surrender&rdquo;, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699621000737127"  target="_blank">posted on TruthSocial </a>on June 17, calling it &#8220;unacceptable and illogical.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier in the conflict, Trump had suggested the possibility of regime change in Iran. &ldquo;If the current Iranian Regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn&rsquo;t there be a regime change???&rdquo; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114729009239087163"  target="_blank">he said</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=yR9VMhV2 autostart="viewable"]</div>



<p>But on Tuesday, en route to the NATO Summit, Trump appeared to backtrack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOKfUQyOiJI"  target="_blank">he told reporters</a> onboard Air Force One.</p>



<p>The conflict began after Israel attacked military and nuclear facilities across Iran on June 13, <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing key military and scientific personnel</a>. After the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://time.com/7294186/israel-warns-tehran-will-burn-deadly-strikes-traded-nuclear-program/" >described</a> Operation Rising Lion as an attack to &ldquo;roll back the Iranian threat to Israel&rsquo;s very survival&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1933626898242056488"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the goal</a> of Israel&#8217;s operation is to prevent the nuclear and ballistic missile threat of the Islamic regime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Khamenei told viewers on Thursday that the U.S. had only intervened because &ldquo;if it didn&rsquo;t, the Zionist regime would be completely destroyed,&rdquo; claiming that Israel &ldquo;was practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.&rdquo; </p>



<p>During the almost two week-long conflict, 974 Iranians were killed in Israeli missile strikes, including 387 civilians and 268 military personnel, according to the<a href="https://www.en-hrana.org/the-eleventh-day-of-israeli-strikes-key-developments/"  target="_blank"> Human Rights Activists News Agency.</a></p>



<p>In Israel, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office confirmed a total of <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/operation-rising-lion-update"  target="_blank">28 people killed</a> as a result of Iranian missile strikes.</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7297634"></div></div>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219259988.jpg" alt="Israel Launches Strikes Against Iran"/>



<p>As Israeli missiles <a href="https://time.com/7294609/iran-israel-war-pictures-strike/" >struck Iranian territory and Tehran fired back</a>, the Middle East veered closer to a full-blown regional war. For the first time since the 1980s, the Islamic Republic faced a direct military assault from another regional power that targeted not only its <a href="https://time.com/7293886/iranian-generals-scientists-targets-killed-by-israeli-strikes/" >military assets</a>, but the symbolic and political heart of the regime itself.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Today, that war is paused under a <a href="https://time.com/7297049/iran-israel-ceasefire-trump/" >tenuous ceasefire</a>, and despite the hopes and near hysterical levels of speculation, the regime remains in power. Iran&rsquo;s rulers may have survived this round, but their legitimacy is more fragile than ever. A tightening of its grip at home and the launching of internal purges to root out alleged Israeli collaborators is certainly on the horizon, if not already underway. The leadership will try to showcase its military resilience but underneath lies a deepening crisis and serious governance challenges remain. While Iranians demonstrated unity against the unprecedented Israeli and U.S. strikes, the war raised urgent questions about the regime&rsquo;s survival and Iran&rsquo;s evolution.</p>



<p>The immediate trigger was military. On June 12, Israel launched strikes deep into Iranian territory, <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >followed by U.S. attacks</a> on June 22 targeting nuclear sites. The Trump Administration framed the operation as a necessary step to &ldquo;permanently eliminate&rdquo; Iran&rsquo;s weapons capabilities. In typical fashion, Trump followed up the strike with a promise to &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7296670/trump-iran-regime-change-khamenei-hegseth-vance-rubio-us-war/" >Make Iran Great Again</a>,&rdquo; implying that regime change was the goal.</p>



<p>But on June 24, Trump reversed course and announced a cease-fire. The terms are vague and the enforcement mechanism unclear. What is clear, however, is that Iran&rsquo;s political and military infrastructure remains largely intact. The idea that a decades-old regime could be brought down from an Israeli aerial campaign without boots on the ground or domestic support has once again proven to be fantasy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Islamic Republic is not a fragile dictatorship held together by a single man. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei&rsquo;s health has long been the subject of conjecture, but the regime has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/succession-plans-irans-khamenei-hit-top-gear-2025-06-23/"  target="_blank">built-in mechanisms for succession</a>. The Revolutionary Guards remain powerful, deeply embedded, and invested in the system&mdash;if not their own survival.</p>



<p>Yet survival is not strength. The war exposed a regime unable to protect its own cities or citizens from foreign attack. The Islamic Republic is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/world/middleeast/iran-israel-hezbollah-houthis-hamas-iraq.html"  target="_blank">more isolated</a> and heavily sanctioned. It has spent decades portraying itself as a guardian of sovereignty, but its projection of power and defense strategy has proved hollow. That failure has opened new space not just for criticism, but for imagination.</p>



<p>For years, Iranians have mobilized to protest what they don&rsquo;t want: clerical rule, corruption, and repression. But in this moment of crisis, a more difficult and essential question of what Iranians want and who gets to decide is resurfacing.</p>



<p>That answer cannot come from exiled monarchs or foreign leaders. It must come from within. The <a href="https://time.com/heroes-of-the-year-2022-women-of-iran/" >Woman, Life, Freedom protests of 2022</a> offered a glimpse, as the most diverse and widespread protests in Iran&rsquo;s modern history. The Iranian diaspora responded with unprecedented energy, organizing rallies and proposing blueprints for a post-Islamic Republic transition. But much of that momentum faltered, in part due to the re-entry of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former Shah, who is again echoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentayahu in his call for Iranians to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd7bba67-bb2a-410f-ab3e-024267f35c4f"  target="_blank">rise up</a>.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The path forward doesn&rsquo;t lie in restoring monarchy, nor in a foreign-brokered government-in-exile. It lies in the hard, deliberate work of building a representative system that reflects and includes the full spectrum of Iranian society across ethnic, religious, regional, and gender lines. It means prioritizing transitional justice over revenge, and institutions over personalities.</p>



<p>Iranians know the perils of externally driven regime change. In 1953, a U.S.- and U.K.-backed coup toppled the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, restoring the Shah and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/690363402/how-the-cia-overthrew-irans-democracy-in-four-days"  target="_blank">burying Iran&rsquo;s early experiment in parliamentary democracy</a>. In 1979, a revolution for freedom was hijacked by a theocratic elite. In both cases, Iranians lost control of their future to opportunists who promised salvation and delivered repression.</p>



<p>Iranians have also long feared the prospect of a Syrian-style civil war, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/how-libyas-years-crisis-unfolded-after-2011-uprising-2024-08-28/"  target="_blank">Libyan-style state collapse</a>, or foreign intervention masked as liberation. These anxieties are not merely historical abstractions or distant lessons drawn from the broader Middle East. They are actively reinforced by the country&rsquo;s ongoing experience of <a href="https://time.com/7210555/iran-shaky-regime/" >international sanctions and economic isolation</a>. Decades of sweeping sanctions have eroded the economic foundations of everyday life, hollowed out state capacity, and left a broken social contract. </p>



<p>The war may be on hold. But the reckoning is far from over. The Iranian state is bloodied but intact, and will certainly seek a way out, possibly through a Trump-led deal that secures its survival, curbs further Israeli attacks, and brings long-awaited sanctions relief. But any diplomatic resolution abroad must be matched by a reckoning at home.</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s at stake is not just foreign policy but political agency. The challenge ahead for Iran is to imagine a future not built by strongmen or imagined by external actors, but on pluralism and new governance that derives its legitimacy from the people.</p>

<p>There are world leaders that Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114623632387180206"  target="_blank">likes</a> and there are others that he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114696999897040583"  target="_blank">clearly doesn&rsquo;t</a>.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Then there are some that he seems to love.</p>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7008717/benjamin-netanyahu-interview/" >Benjamin Netanyahu</a> is one of those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his first term, Trump welcomed Netanyahu to the White House less than a month after taking office and called the Israeli leader his &ldquo;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/full-transcript-trump-netanyahu-talk-of-regional-approach-to-peace-at-white-house-press-conference/"  target="_blank">friend</a>,&rdquo; while Netanyahu <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/netanyahu-trump-praise-235059"  target="_blank">piled praise</a> on the U.S. President. A few months after that, Trump took his first foreign trip to Israel, where he would later move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, earning <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/you-have-made-history-netanyahu-hails-trump-at-jerusalem-embassy-opening/"  target="_blank">more praise</a> from his friend.</p>



<p>But like all great friendships, the Trump-Netanyahu bromance has had its ups and downs.</p>



<p>After Joe Biden&rsquo;s election in 2020, Trump said &ldquo;f-ck him&rdquo; about Netanyahu during an interview with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/12/10/trump-netanyahu-disloyalty-fuck-him"  target="_blank">Axios</a>, explaining: &ldquo;The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. &hellip; Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.&rdquo;</p>



<p>After he was elected again in 2024, Trump told <a href="https://time.com/7201565/person-of-the-year-2024-donald-trump-transcript/" >TIME</a>, when he was asked if he trusted Netanyahu: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust anybody.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Their relationship apparently mended, however, by the time Trump took office again, as Netanyahu was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/trump-netanyahu-white-house-visit"  target="_blank">first foreign leader</a> invited to the White House and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/netanyahu-trump-meeting-gaza-tariffs"  target="_blank">since visited again</a>.</p>



<p>Trump even <a href="https://time.com/7295726/netanyahu-trump-israel-iran-nuclear-strikes/" >proved that he would go to war for his friend</a>.</p>



<p>As Israel&rsquo;s conflict with Iran raged on earlier this month, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1097012489158726"  target="_blank">called</a> Trump a &ldquo;tremendous friend&rdquo; and said he spoke with him nearly every day.</p>



<p>And after Trump authorized <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >strikes on Iranian nuclear sites</a> last weekend, Trump thanked and congratulated Netanyahu by name, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/22/us-attacks-iran-how-trump-rejoined-team-netanyahu"  target="_blank">saying</a>, &ldquo;We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we&rsquo;ve gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Israel has never had a greater friend than President Trump in the White House,&rdquo; Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1937596683929502193"  target="_blank">said</a> Tuesday, after Trump briefly <a href="https://time.com/7297315/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump-f-bomb/" >flashed some frustration</a> with Israel and Iran for <a href="https://time.com/7297098/israel-iran-ceasefire-broken-missile-strikes-tehran/" >nearly upending</a> a <a href="https://time.com/7297049/iran-israel-ceasefire-trump/" >delicate ceasefire</a>.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, however, Trump went a step further in his show of support, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114746355912265245"  target="_blank">taking to Truth Social</a> to go to bat for &ldquo;Bibi&rdquo; by trying to give his friend a much-needed boost at home, where Netanyahu faces a number of political challenges.</p>



<p>Trump blasted what he called a &ldquo;Witch Hunt&rdquo; against Israel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great War Time Prime Minister.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Bibi and I just went through HELL together, fighting a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel, Iran, and Bibi could not have been better, sharper, or stronger in his LOVE for the incredible Holy Land,&rdquo; Trump wrote. &ldquo;Anybody else would have suffered losses, embarrassment, and chaos!&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Bibi Netanyahu was a WARRIOR, like perhaps no other Warrior in the History of Israel, and the result was something that nobody thought was possible, a complete elimination of potentially one of the biggest and most powerful Nuclear Weapons anywhere in the World,&rdquo; Trump continued, repeating a <a href="https://time.com/7297464/nuclear-diplomacy-iran-us-strikes-damage-non-proliferation-treaty-weapon/" >debated claim</a>, &ldquo;and it was going to happen, SOON! We were fighting, literally, for the Survival of Israel, and there is nobody in Israel&rsquo;s History that fought harder or more competently than Bibi Netanyahu.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump went on to call it a &ldquo;TRAVESTY OF &lsquo;JUSTICE&rsquo;&rdquo; that Netanyahu faces trial on Monday on longstanding corruption charges that Trump, who himself has faced <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-warren-reads-100-acts-of-trump-corruption-into-congressional-record-to-mark-100-days-of-the-trump-administration"  target="_blank">accusations of corruption</a> and has been <a href="https://time.com/6983196/donald-trump-convicted-hush-money-trial-new-york/" >convicted of fraud</a>, called a &ldquo;Horror Show&rdquo; and &ldquo;politically motivated case, &lsquo;concerning cigars, a Bugs Bunny doll, and numerous other unfair charges&rsquo; in order to do him great harm.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Such a WITCH HUNT, for a man who has given so much, is unthinkable to me,&rdquo; said Trump. &ldquo;He deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu&rsquo;s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero, who has done so much for the State. Perhaps there is no one that I know who could have worked in better harmony with the President of the United States, ME, than Bibi Netanyahu. It was the United States of America that saved Israel, and now it is going to be the United States of America that saves Bibi Netanyahu.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Whether and how the U.S. can save Netanyahu, who has faced <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/benjamin-netanyahu/article-845290"  target="_blank">calls for resignation</a> and whose coalition government has struggled to barely keep its grip on power, remains to be seen. While the war with Iran gave the Israeli leader a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-shows-post-war-popularity-bump-for-pm-and-likud-but-no-majority-for-his-coalition/"  target="_blank">popularity boost</a>, according to polls, it&rsquo;s unclear how long that will last before a number of issues, not limited to the corruption trial, catch up to him.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about Netanyahu&rsquo;s domestic challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Corruption trial</h2>



<p>Netanyahu&rsquo;s corruption trial presents perhaps the biggest threat to his political future in Israel. In December, he made national history as the first sitting Prime Minister to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-take-stand-his-corruption-trial-first-time-2024-12-09/"  target="_blank">take the stand</a> as a criminal defendant.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It was not a happy day to see the Prime Minister in court,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjlfs00v1g"  target="_blank">said</a> Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who has the power to grant Netanyahu clemency, at the time. But Herzog added that a pardon was &ldquo;not currently on the table.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-indicted.html"  target="_blank">2019</a>, Netanyahu has faced three separate cases of corruption, which include charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. Netanyahu denies the charges and has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/netanyahu-pleads-not-guilty-to-corruption-as-trial-resumes-idUSKBN2A80JG/"  target="_blank">pleaded not guilty</a>. If convicted, Netanyahu may be jailed for up to 10 years.</p>



<p>In one case, Netanyahu is accused of granting regulatory favors to telecommunications company Bezeq in exchange for positive coverage of him and his wife Sara on a news website once controlled by the company&rsquo;s former chairman.</p>



<p>Another case alleges that Netanyahu and his wife received lavish gifts worth around $200,000&mdash;including cigars and Champagne&mdash;from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer in exchange for Milchan&rsquo;s business benefits. (Prosecutors <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/prosecutor-netanyahus-wife-asked-hollywood-mogul-to-gift-large-bugs-bunny-toy-to-her-son-in-1996/"  target="_blank">alleged</a> that Milchan also gave Netanyahu&rsquo;s son a large Bugs Bunny toy back in 1996 as a way to seek favors from the Israeli leader during his first term as Prime Minister.)</p>



<p>The third case alleges an arrangement between Netanyahu and newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes. The deal allegedly promised Netanyahu positive coverage in Mozes&rsquo; newspaper <em>Yediot Ahronoth</em> while the Israeli Prime Minister would consider legislation unfavorable to rival newspaper <em>Israel Hayom</em>.</p>



<p>Netanyahu has called the charges <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-fumes-at-court-in-corruption-trial-testimony-lower-your-tone-judge-responds/"  target="_blank">&ldquo;absurd&rdquo; and a &ldquo;complete lie.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>He has requested numerous delays in the trial, citing the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-trial-delayed-by-over-2-months-as-court-activity-limited-over-virus/"  target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, his <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/premier-netanyahu-uses-health-issues-to-avoid-corruption-trial-for-3rd-week-in-a-row/3453648"  target="_blank">health issues</a>, and the war in Gaza, the latter of which critics have <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/netanyahu-using-gaza-war-to-evade-corruption-trial-ex-israeli-general-18207838"  target="_blank">accused</a> Netanyahu of prolonging to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-rejects-netanyahus-request-to-delay-testimony-in-criminal-trial/"  target="_blank">evade</a> accountability in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/cross-examination-of-netanyahu-in-criminal-trial-to-begin-on-tuesday/"  target="_blank"><em>Times of Israel</em></a>, Netanyahu has testified 36 times in direct questioning by his own attorney since December and at the start of this month began facing twice-weekly cross-examination, which could extend for another year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Public discontent</h2>



<p>In June, the Netanyahu coalition government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/israels-netanyahu-survives-opposition-bid-to-dissolve-parliament"  target="_blank">narrowly survived</a> a no-confidence vote that would have dissolved parliament and effectively ousted him from the premiership. The next day, he <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-political-woes-take-back-seat-as-critics-unite-behind-him-over-iran/"  target="_blank">temporarily united the country</a> against an external enemy when he <a href="https://time.com/7293795/israel-strikes-iran-attack-what-to-know/" >launched an attack against Iran</a>. But with that war seemingly subsided, his fragile hold on power will take center stage again.</p>



<p>The country faces sharp divisions over the war in Gaza, judicial reform, and military conscription, among other issues.</p>



<p>Netanyahu has faced mounting criticism for how he&rsquo;s handled the war in Gaza, for which he faces <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/defendant/netanyahu"  target="_blank">charges of war crimes</a>, and how he has not presented a viable plan for an end to the conflict. Families of Israeli hostages have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/24/families-of-israeli-captives-criticise-netanyahu-amid-large-protests"  target="_blank">blamed Netanyahu</a> for being unable to bring back all the captives. And according to one poll, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-most-israelis-think-pm-cares-more-about-holding-power-than-winning-war-freeing-hostages/"  target="_blank">most Israelis believe</a> the Israeli Prime Minister is more interested in remaining in power than winning the war or freeing hostages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Left-wing politician Yair Golan, a former Israel Defense Forces official, <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-becoming-pariah-state-kills-children-in-gaza-as-a-hobby-opposition-leader-golan/3573551"  target="_blank">said</a> in May that &ldquo;Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don&rsquo;t return to acting like a sane country.&rdquo; And Netanyahu&rsquo;s former defense minister, Moshe Ya&rsquo;alon, <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-sending-soldiers-commit-war-crimes-gaza-says-former-army-chief?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Social_Traffic&amp;utm_content=ap_f8i6vkzqyd"  target="_blank">said</a> also last month that &ldquo;this government has lost touch with Jewish morality and the interests of the State of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has also faced domestic protests over judicial reform and military conscription.</p>



<p>Since the government revealed plans of a judicial overhaul in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/20/what-are-israels-judicial-changes-causing-uproar"  target="_blank">January 2023</a>, thousands have taken to the streets in sustained protests. Later that year, the protests intensified following parliament&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6297024/israel-judicial-reform-protest/" >passage</a> of a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ajc.org/news/what-is-israels-reasonableness-legislation-and-why-is-it-so-contentious"  target="_blank">reasonableness</a>&rdquo; law, which in effect disempowered the Supreme Court and lower courts from cancelling government decisions it deemed unreasonable. The Supreme Court ruled that the law was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67859177"  target="_blank">unconstitutional</a> in January 2024.</p>



<p>But the protests were reignited in March, when Israel&rsquo;s parliament <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/27/israels-parliament-passes-law-to-expand-coontrol-over-judge-appointments"  target="_blank">passed a law</a> remaking the country&rsquo;s judiciary in what many see as part of Netanyahu&rsquo;s plan to quash the convictions against him. The law grants politicians more power in the appointment of judges. After its passage, thousands <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/03/thousands-protest-against-new-israel-law-expanding-control-over-judicial"  target="_blank">took to the streets again</a> to decry what critics called a &ldquo;nail in the coffin of Israeli democracy.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Another issue that has long divided Israel is the military conscription of ultra-Orthodox Jewish young men.</p>



<p>Military service in Israel is mandatory, and has become even more depended on as the country gets entangled in ever more regional conflicts. A decades-long arrangement, however, has allowed ultra-Orthodox Jews to study religious texts in lieu of participating in the draft. But in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/25/g-s1-6116/israeli-supreme-court-rules-that-the-military-must-begin-drafting-ultra-orthodox-men"  target="_blank">June 2024</a>, months into Israel&rsquo;s war on Gaza, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that it can no longer afford that exemption.</p>



<p>Since the court ruling, thousands have <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-data-reveals-massive-number-of-ultra-orthodox-jews-refuse-to-enlist-in-military-service/3546859"  target="_blank">refused the draft</a> despite strict sanctions. Netanyahu faces pressure from his own Likud party to conscript more ultra-Orthodox men amid the conflict, but two ultra-Orthodox parties in his governing coalition&mdash;Shas and United Torah Judaism&mdash;have demanded a formal and permanent exemption from military service to override the Supreme Court decision. And if they don&rsquo;t get their way, the parties have <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shas-set-to-join-utj-in-backing-knessets-dissolution-stripping-coalition-of-majority/"  target="_blank">threatened to quit the coalition</a> and push for the dissolution of parliament.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to bring down a right-wing government,&rdquo; a Shas spokesperson <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2603928/middle-east"  target="_blank">said</a> earlier this month. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve reached our limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald Trump loves to give nicknames.

<p>Rutte earlier lauded Trump, according to text messages Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738606142462442"  target="_blank">posted</a> to his Truth Social platform, for <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >authorizing strikes</a> on three nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend.</p>



<p>When asked Wednesday about Rutte calling him &ldquo;daddy,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-asked-about-nato-chief-mark-rutte-calling-him-daddy-242239045532"  target="_blank">said</a>: &ldquo;He likes me. If he doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll let you know, I&rsquo;ll come back, and I&rsquo;ll hit him hard.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;He did it very affectionately, &lsquo;Daddy, you&rsquo;re my daddy,&rsquo;&rdquo; Trump imitated.</p>

Do you regard your NATO  allies as kind of children?&quot;<br><br>Trump: &quot;I think he likes me. If he doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll let you know&#8230;He did. He did it very affectionately.

<p>Rutte later tried to <a href="https://x.com/reuters/status/1938060899639537856"  target="_blank">clarify</a> that he did not mean to call Trump &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; but rather to liken Trump&rsquo;s relationship to Europe to that of a father figure. &ldquo;What I said is that sometimes, in Europe, I hear sometimes countries saying, &lsquo;Hey, Mark, will the U.S. stay with us?&rsquo; And I said that sounds a little bit like a small child asking his daddy, &lsquo;Hey, are you still staying with the family?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time Trump&rsquo;s been called daddy, and he seems to like it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 2023 interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, golfer John Daly <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tuckercarlson/video/7312855307552853294"  target="_blank">said</a> he and fellow golfers &ldquo;want Daddy Trump back.&rdquo; Trump posted about the reference on Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111586208943521719"  target="_blank">at the time</a> and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112315147940969000"  target="_blank">again a few months later</a>. Daly <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/d4fgQMUKhE0"  target="_blank">has said</a> he&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/5Iv7jrti9MQ"  target="_blank">called Trump &ldquo;daddy&rdquo;</a> since the two met in 1992.</p>



<p>Carlson also once compared Trump to a father figure at an October 2024 rally when he likened some of the American public to a &ldquo;hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter&rdquo; who&rsquo;s been allowed to &ldquo;slam the door and give you the finger.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;There has to be a point at which Dad comes home,&rdquo; Carlson <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/9naoY75-g0g"  target="_blank">said</a>. &ldquo;And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been a bad girl. You&rsquo;ve been a bad little girl, and you&rsquo;re getting a vigorous spanking right now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Democracy is not a gift, nor a given; it is the hard-earned result of generations of struggle, sacrifice, and resistance. That is why I believe democratic ideals and institutions must be fiercely protected&mdash;everywhere, by all of us, at all times.</p>



<p>For years I have spoken of the ups and downs of this path in Iran, my own country, of our hopes for democracy, and the solidarity we seek from democratic and human rights institutions around the world. But today I speak as someone sounding <a href="https://time.com/7266334/us-human-rights-watchlist-civil-liberties/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an alarm</a>, as one who knows from experience what it means to lose democracy&mdash;not slowly, but almost overnight.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>I want to remind you that the rights and freedoms you may take for granted are not guaranteed. They can be eroded if they not actively protected. Whether you feel it yet or not, you, too, are engaged in the same fragile struggle: <a href="https://time.com/6338333/angelina-jolie-narges-mohammadi-nobel-peace-prize/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the defense of democracy and human rights</a>. Perhaps this reflection, born of experience and resistance, can play a small part in reinforcing what we all stand to lose. And perhaps, in this shared vulnerability, we will come to see how much more deeply we are connected.</p>



<p>We see ourselves as your partners in defending democracy&mdash;not just because our futures are connected, but because the existence of democracy in the West has long been a source of hope and inspiration, a guiding model for those of us still struggling for it elsewhere.<strong> </strong>When democracy is <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2025/uphill-battle-to-safeguard-rights"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">weakened</a> in one part of the world, it sends shockwaves through the hopes of people everywhere who are still fighting to achieve it.</p>



<p>From the days when only men could vote and hold power, to the long fight that led to women gain equal rights; from the era when skin color justified slavery, to the moment when people of all races, genders, and backgrounds could lead a nation, democracy has been shaped through struggle. And that struggle never truly ends. It is what gives meaning to our shared humanity and carries the promise that tomorrow can be more just than today.</p>



<p>That is why the <a href="https://time.com/5606244/stanford-expert-mr-democracy-interview/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing fragility </a>of democracy around the world should alarm us all. When the foundations of democracy are weakened even in the West, it threatens not just political systems, but an entire way of life built on dignity, freedom, and solidarity. I say this as someone who has lived through its collapse&mdash;who has<a href="https://time.com/7203735/narges-mohammadi-margaret-atwood/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> been made a stranger in her own country</a>, and who has resisted religious tyranny and gender apartheid. Don&rsquo;t believe the myth that history only moves forward. If you don&rsquo;t act today&mdash;with clarity and urgency&mdash;you may wake up tomorrow in a world where the very idea of democracy has vanished, and realize too late that your silence helped erase it.<br><br><strong>Read more:</strong><a href="Iranian Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi Calls for Israel-Iran Ceasefire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Iranian Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi Calls for Israel-Iran Ceasefire</a></p>



<p>Just look at what&rsquo;s happening to the media and freedom of speech. Once the fourth pillar of democracy&mdash;essential for transparency and accountability&mdash;it is, in many cases, turning into a tool for manipulating public opinion: a vehicle for fear, hate, and the silencing of truth.</p>



<p>Or look at universities. These institutions were meant to be sanctuaries of knowledge, curiosity, and intellectual freedom. In Iran, we call them &ldquo;the strongholds of liberty.&rdquo; But today, even some of these spaces are <a href="https://time.com/7278236/university-funding-trump-harvard-cornell-northwestern-brown-princeton-penn-columbia/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their independence</a>&mdash;becoming arenas for power struggles, where truth is sacrificed to political or financial agendas, and the ethical foundations of education and research are under attack.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s step back and consider globalization. For years, we saw it as a <a href="https://humanprogress.org/globalizations-triumph-the-death-of-extreme-poverty/"  target="_blank">triumph</a>&mdash;the breaking down of barriers, the sharing of ideas, the merging of cultures. But what we&rsquo;re witnessing now isn&rsquo;t the reversal of globalization, it&rsquo;s its backlash. When globalization was enforced from above, driven primarily by economic interests and market expansion, with little regard for social justice, shared values, or real dialogue, it created fractures. Yes, some visible walls fell&mdash;but invisible ones rose in their place. What Americans now see at their borders is just the surface expression of deeper divisions that have been building for years.</p>



<p>Now let&rsquo;s take another step back to the very idea of parliamentary democracy&mdash;government of the people, by the people, for the people. Isn&rsquo;t it true that, in some cases, it is being hollowed out from within? I recall the words of Immanuel Kant: &ldquo;The greatest evil occurs when a concept is destroyed in the name of that same concept.&rdquo; So how do we ensure that institutions like the media, universities, and elections stay true to their purpose&mdash;empowering people, protecting rights, and advancing freedom?</p>



<p>Perhaps these questions sound basic to you. But in Iran, they are distant hopes. Our state media has always been a mouthpiece for power. Our universities have always been under state control. Just recently, the Judiciary&rsquo;s spokesperson declared that &ldquo;violence, like terrorism, is a Western concept&rdquo;&mdash;openly dismissing universal values. As for democratic institutions and peaceful transitions of power, we have yet to even begin.</p>



<p>And it&rsquo;s precisely because of the distance between our worlds&mdash;and from a place of deep sincerity&mdash;that I offer this not as a complaint, but as a warning. These are alarm bells. Yes, fighting back trench by trench is essential, but it is not enough. Today&rsquo;s global crises are tightly interwoven: war, poverty, climate collapse, gender oppression, systemic racism, rising authoritarianism, religious extremism, economic inequality. Together, they form a single, comprehensive global crisis.<br><br><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/6321404/nobel-laureate-narges-mohammadis-evin-prison/" >Read the Nobel Peace Laureate&#8217;s Gripping Account of the Fire in Her Prison</a> <br><br>The unfortunate truth is this: the current framework of Western democratic systems appears unprepared for the scale and complexity of this challenge. If democratic governments continue to respond with fragmented, issue-by-issue solutions&mdash;without a coherent and collective strategy&mdash;we will all face the accelerating erosion of democracy.</p>



<p>We know what defeat looks like. In places like Iran, it&rsquo;s a familiar companion. Unlike in systems where victory is often the main goal, we&rsquo;ve learned to survive defeat, learn from it, and keep going. And yes, more setbacks will come. But this struggle is not lost&mdash;and we are not powerless.</p>



<p>Democracy, at its best, is <a href="https://time.com/7071872/us-trial-and-error-essay/" >self-correcting</a>. It can learn from its mistakes, regenerate from the ground up, and grow stronger through inclusion. It offers the widest space for participation. And on this road, we walk guided by a shared compass: freedom (individual and collective), equality (of opportunity and dignity), and solidarity (especially with the vulnerable and the silenced).</p>



<p>Perhaps it is time to imagine a new future for global democracy&mdash;one rooted not in the preservation of old power structures, but in the full potential of democratic ideals. Because democracy is weakened when too much attention is placed on state power alone. In geopolitical games, every state seeks to win by taking more. But in the world of civil society, we win by giving more.</p>



<p>This is the logic that has long connected us. Civil society institutions in democratic countries gave us legitimacy, recognition, and strength when our own democratic institutions were crushed. And we&mdash;those who have resisted tyranny under relentless pressure&mdash;have in return offered something vital: the knowledge, experience, and example of nonviolent resistance.</p>



<p>Our differences matter far less than what unites us. We are two ends of the same fragile, global transition. And the success of this process depends on seriousness, unity, and the creation of a global alliance of democratic and civil institutions&mdash;to defend and revive democracy for all.</p>

<div class="brief-podcast-player"><h3 class="podcast-title">The Brief June 26, 2025</h3><h4>Updates on Trump and Netanyahu, NATO, and more</h4><p>Podcast ID &#8211; Short Length: <code>b7fcd5fa-8b0b-42f4-8537-e8a9c5a4fa72</code></p><p>Podcast ID &#8211; Long Length: <code>7973a270-49d3-4627-9c57-9b8e50dfc9d8</code></p></div>



<p>In a week that dealt with the aftermath of the <a href="https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/" >U.S. launching strikes on Iran</a> and the <a href="https://time.com/7297123/trump-warns-israel-bombs-iran-ceasefire/" >brokering of an Israel-Iran cease-fire</a>, albeit a fragile one, global leaders put on a somewhat united front at the 2025 NATO Summit.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>President Donald Trump arrived at The Hague in the Netherlands on Tuesday, hours after issuing a <a href="https://time.com/7297123/trump-warns-israel-bombs-iran-ceasefire/" >public rebuke of Israel and Iran</a> amid accusations of <a href="https://time.com/7297098/israel-iran-ceasefire-broken-missile-strikes-tehran/https://time.com/7297098/israel-iran-ceasefire-broken-missile-strikes-tehran/" >cease-fire violations</a> and threats of further military action. Unsurprisingly, the Israel-Iran conflict, and its far-reaching impact, was a key talking point during the summit.</p>



<p>NATO members also discussed defense spending, with the United Kingdom set to buy at least a dozen F-35 capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and Spain <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-06-25/spain-is-a-problem-trump-lashes-out-over-nato-contributions.html"  target="_blank">showing restraint on committing</a> to the 5% defense spending target.</p>



<p>The war in Ukraine was a key focus of the summit too, with leaders reiterating <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_236641.htm"  target="_blank">their support for President Volodymyr Zelensky</a> as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, posing an ongoing, prevalent concern for European security.</p>



<p>Here are the key takeaways from the 2025 NATO Summit. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Debate over the effectiveness of U.S. missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities</strong></h2>



<p>Early U.S. intelligence on the weekend strikes carried out in Iran <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites"  target="_blank">reportedly suggests</a> that they were not as effective as initially thought, in stark contrast to Trump&rsquo;s assertion that the strikes &ldquo;totally obliterated&#8221; the three key nuclear facilities.</p>



<p>Speaking at NATO, Trump doubled down on his previous statements, saying that the operation &ldquo;was very, very successful. It was called <em>obliteration</em>. No other military on Earth could have done it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The President cited a report from the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, saying it found that U.S. strikes &ldquo;destroyed the site&#8217;s critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable. It was devastated.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Per Trump, the report concluded that Iran&rsquo;s ability to develop nuclear weapons had been set back &ldquo;for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Israel&#8217;s military meanwhile, has said that it&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-assesses-irans-nuclear-program-set-back-years-but-too-early-to-know-for-sure/"  target="_blank">still too early to determine</a>&#8221; the exact outcome and effectiveness of the strikes upon Iran&#8217;s nuclear infrastructure.</p>



<p>Trump was also asked at NATO about sanctions on Iran and its capability to continue selling oil to China, its main trading partner in the industry. &ldquo;I could stop it if I wanted and sell China the oil myself. I don&#8217;t want to do that,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;We&#8217;re not taking over the oil. We could have, you know, I used to say with Iraq, &#8216;keep the oil.&#8217; I could say it here, too.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sitting with <a href="https://time.com/7295448/rutte-nato-secretary-general-interview/" >NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte</a>, Trump was<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9x809vgrro"  target="_blank"> asked by reporters</a> if the U.S. would strike Iran again, should it rebuild its nuclear facilities. To which the President responded: &ldquo;Sure, but I&#8217;m not going to have to worry about that. It&#8217;s gone for years.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump reacts after he&#8217;s referred to as &#8220;daddy&#8221;</strong></h2>



<p>When praising Trump&#8217;s intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict, Rutte referred to the U.S. President as <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nato-chief-heaps-praise-on-trump-at-meeting-after-us-president-cast-doubt-on-commitment-to-collective-defence-13388255"  target="_blank">&ldquo;daddy.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>Trump compared Israel and Iran to &ldquo;two kids in a school yard&rdquo; who &ldquo;fight like hell,&rdquo; to which Rutte, referencing Trump&rsquo;s intervention, said: &ldquo;Then daddy has to sometimes use strong language.&#8221;</p>



<p>(In an outburst ahead of the summit, Trump told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday: &#8220;We have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard, that they don&#8217;t know what the f-ck they&#8217;re doing.&#8221;)</p>



<p>The remark from Rutte seemed to catch the room off-guard, and Trump was later confronted about the moment during a press conference.</p>



<p>When asked asked if he considers NATO members to be like &#8220;his children,&#8221; Trump said of Rutte&#8217;s comment: &#8220;He likes me, I think he likes me. If he doesn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll let you know. I&#8217;ll come back, and I&#8217;ll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately&#8230; &#8216;daddy, you&#8217;re my daddy.'&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NATO allies agree on 5% defense spending target and an &#8220;ironclad&#8221; Article 5 commitment</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236705.htm?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=posts&amp;utm_campaign=250625%2Bmulti%2Bdeclaration"  target="_blank">In a joint statement</a> from 32 NATO leaders at the summit, the countries agreed to 5% of annual GDP going on &ldquo;core defence requirements as well as defence-and security-related spending&rdquo; by 2035.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We remain united and steadfast in our resolve to protect our one billion citizens, defend the Alliance, and safeguard our freedom and democracy,&rdquo; the statement read.</p>



<p>The 5% target is well beyond what any NATO country currently spends on defense, and a significant increase on <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm"  target="_blank">the previous 2% guideline</a> laid out by the organization. <a href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf"  target="_blank">As of 2024</a>, Poland spends an estimated 4.2% of their annual GDP on defense, at that point the highest of all members.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf"  target="_blank">The United States</a> spent an estimated 3.38% in 2024, a slight decrease from spending percentages throughout the ten years prior.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236705.htm?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=posts&amp;utm_campaign=250625%2Bmulti%2Bdeclaration"  target="_blank">NATO members say</a> that the aim of this new target is to provide security in the face of the &ldquo;long- term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security and the persistent threat of terrorism.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty&mdash;that an attack on one is an attack on all,&rdquo; the NATO leaders said.</p>



<p>Should one NATO member be attacked, <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm"  target="_blank">Article 5 commits</a> all other members to take the action &ldquo;it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.&rdquo;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm"  target="_blank">The only occasion</a> that Article 5 has previously been invoked was after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>



<p>Both commitments have been regularly brought up by Trump. Speaking at a press conference at the summit, he said: &ldquo;This will be known as the Hague defense commitment&hellip; it will add $1 trillion a year. It&rsquo;s a monumental win for the United States because we were carrying much more than our fair share, which was quite unfair actually.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Reiterating his &ldquo;America first&rdquo; mantra, Trump added that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;vital that this additional money be spent on very serious military hardware, not bureaucracy. And hopefully that hardware is going to be made in America.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zelensky warns Russia could attack a Nato country within the next five years</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking with Sky News in The Hague, Zelensky was asked if the 2035 spending commitment from NATO members was too slow.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is slow, we believe starting in 2030 [Russian President Vladimir] Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>When asked if he believes if Russia could attack a NATO member, putting Article 5 to the test, Zelensky replied: &#8220;Precisely so, I believe so.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump also commented about the ongoing efforts to procure a lasting cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, saying that he had shared a phone call with Putin, during which the Russian President offered support in Middle Eastern negotiations. &ldquo;I said &lsquo;No, no, you help me get a settlement with <em>you</em>, with Russia&rsquo;, and I think we&#8217;re going to be doing that too,&rdquo; Trump emphasized. &ldquo;Putin really has to end that war. People are dying at levels that people haven&#8217;t seen before for a long time.&rdquo;</p>



<p>When asked if the U.S. is willing to sell anti-air missiles to Ukraine, Trump said &ldquo;we&#8217;re going to see if we can make some available.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Ukraine crisis has also highlighted the urgency of rebuilding our defense industrial base, both in the United States and among the allied nations. We cannot afford to be dependent on foreign adversaries for critical minerals,&rdquo; Trump said, highlighting <a href="https://time.com/7282110/ukraine-minerals-deal/" >the economic deal signed with Ukraine</a> in May.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ukraine membership</strong></h2>



<p>There was no official word on Ukraine&rsquo;s long-sought after NATO membership, which has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymn8zyrp9o"  target="_blank">been a key talking point </a>over the past few years, even more so since Russia&rsquo;s invasion in 2022.</p>



<p>&ldquo;NATO has no business in Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, neither Russia, my job is to keep it as it is,&rdquo; <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/key-moments-from-nato-summit-13388538"  target="_blank">said Hungarian Prime Minister</a> Viktor Orb&aacute;n at the summit.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NATO remains clear on its stance.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ukraine is not a NATO member. Ukraine is a NATO partner country, which means that it cooperates closely with NATO but it is not covered by the security guarantee in the Alliance&rsquo;s founding treaty,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_192648.htm"  target="_blank">the organisation&rsquo;s website reads</a>, adding that &ldquo;NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia&#8217;s brutal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>World leaders react to the fragile Israel-Iran cease-fire</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoKhak3qJ7E"  target="_blank">Speaking at a NATO press conference</a> on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reacted to the fragile cease-fire between Iran and Israel, praising the U.S. intervention.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We need to make sure that the cease-fire holds, and seize this opportunity to stabilize the region and get Iran back round the negotiation table with the United States. Ultimately this is how we will ensure a complete, verifiable, and irreversible to Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme,&rdquo; Starmer said.</p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said that the analysis of the damage from U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities is ongoing, including a French investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will compare that with the analysis of other countries, Israel, the United States, and other Europeans,&#8221; Macron divulged at the summit.</p>



<p>In his joint press conference with President Trump, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHJGeyP3x20"  target="_blank">Rutte also commented</a> on the U.S missile strikes, saying: &#8220;This was crucial, you [Trump] did it in a way that is extremely impressive. The signal that it sends to the rest of the world is this President when it comes to it&hellip; he is willing to use strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the simmered-down tensions, <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202506251053"  target="_blank">telling reporters</a>: &ldquo;If the cease-fire between Iran and Israel succeeds, it will be a good development that makes the Mideast and the entire world safer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two pictures spoiled Mads&rsquo; dream vacation,&rdquo; read a <a href="https://www.nordlys.no/mads-sin-drommereise-til-usa-spolert-pa-grunn-av-satirebilde-pa-mobilen/s/5-34-2171723"  target="_blank">headline</a> from Norwegian newspaper <em>Nordlys</em> on Monday, which was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14842359/Norwegian-tourist-21-barred-entering-US-ICE-guards-meme.html"  target="_blank">amplified</a> by British tabloid the <em>Daily Mail</em> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>Mads Mikkelsen&mdash;not <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586568/"  target="_blank">the Danish actor</a> but a 21-year-old tourist from Norway&mdash;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLPnDeQuBtR/"  target="_blank">told his hometown outlet</a> that he was denied entry to the U.S. at Newark Liberty International Airport on June 11 after handing over his phone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials who came across a meme of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance.</p>



<p>Mikkelsen claimed the officials threatened him with a $5,000 fine or five years in prison if he refused to give the password to his mobile device and that, after he relented and it was scrutinized, he was sent back to Norway.</p>



<p>On social media, anti-Trump influencers including former Republican congressman <a href="https://x.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1937575742227046418"  target="_blank">Adam Kinzinger</a> and #Resistance movement activist <a href="https://x.com/krassenstein/status/1937623798809002159"  target="_blank">Brian Krassenstein</a>, among others, shared reports of the denial of entry and encouraged the spreading of more Vance memes, which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/03/08/how-jd-vance-edit-memes-broke-the-internet/"  target="_blank">became popular</a> after President Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7262883/trump-zelensky-meeting/" >explosive meeting</a> with <a href="https://time.com/7270880/zelensky-trump-putin-ukraine-endgame-interview/" >Volodomyr Zelensky</a> in the Oval Office in February, when Vance demanded the Ukrainian President say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Trump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the same people who blame Europe for a lack of free speech,&rdquo; disinformation researcher Pekka Kallioniemi <a href="https://x.com/P_Kallioniemi/status/1937497385892024527"  target="_blank">posted on X</a> about the Trump Administration in relation to the story.</p>



<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), called the claims of Mikkelsen&rsquo;s denied entry over the Vance meme <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1937644506872193279"  target="_blank">&ldquo;FALSE&rdquo; and &ldquo;BS.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>CBP said in a <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1937651325354795444"  target="_blank">post on X</a> that &ldquo;Mads Mikkelsen was not denied entry for any memes or political reasons, it was for his admitted drug use.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The second photo seen by the ICE officials, by Mikkelsen&rsquo;s own admission, was a wooden pipe he&rsquo;d made himself a few years ago. He also told <em>Nordlys</em> that the officials asked him &ldquo;direct questions about drug smuggling, terrorist plots, and right-wing extremism&rdquo; and that he had been forced to give a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tourist-mads-mikkelsen-claims-he-was-denied-entry-to-us-because-of-vance-meme-on-phone/?via=twitter_page&amp;utm_source=twitter_owned_tdb&amp;utm_campaign=owned_social&amp;utm_medium=socialflow"  target="_blank">blood sample</a>.</p>



<p>It remains unclear why Mikkelsen was subjected to heightened scrutiny. CBP did not answer TIME&rsquo;s requests for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bigger picture</h2>



<p>Tighter immigration controls, however, have become a cornerstone of Trump&rsquo;s second term.</p>



<p>Besides <a href="https://time.com/7291314/trump-new-travel-ban-countries-immigrant-entry-restrictions-nonimmigrant-visas/" >an outright ban on nationals from certain countries and heightened vigilance on nationals from others</a>, the Trump Administration has required immigration officials to improve vetting procedures for some non-immigrant visas, including <a href="https://time.com/7295949/international-student-visas-colleges-universities-social-media-state-department-trump/" >social media screening of international student visa applicants</a>. DHS also announced in April that authorities would begin screening the social media accounts of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. for &ldquo;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism"  target="_blank">antisemitic activity</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While border agents have long been empowered to deny entry on a case-by-case basis, reports of increased <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/as-trumps-new-travel-ban-begins-some-visitors-report-extra-scrutiny-at-u-s-airports"  target="_blank">scrutiny</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34"  target="_blank">detentions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-immigration-detained-visitors-border-search-device-visa-passport-rcna197736"  target="_blank">denials</a> of tourists have proliferated in recent months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some incidents have sparked concerns about border agents&rsquo; discretion becoming politicized. In March, a French minister <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2025/03/19/etats-unis-un-chercheur-francais-refoule-pour-avoir-exprime-une-opinion-personnelle-sur-la-politique-menee-par-l-administration-trump_6583618_3210.html"  target="_blank">deplored</a> how a researcher for the French National Center for Scientific Research was denied entry to the U.S. after authorities found &ldquo;personal opinion on the Trump administration&#8217;s research policy&rdquo; on his phone. And just last week, border agents reportedly <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-16/australian-denied-entry-united-states-israel-gaza-columbia/105419154"  target="_blank">sent back</a> an Australian writer to Melbourne from Los Angeles after they interrogated him about his views on the conflict in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some countries, including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-risk-alert-tourists-travelling-us-2025-04-09/"  target="_blank">China</a>, <a href="https://um.dk/rejse-og-ophold/rejse-til-udlandet/pas-og-visum/usa"  target="_blank">Denmark,</a> and <a href="https://um.fi/resemeddelande/-/c/US"  target="_blank">Finland</a>, have issued travel advisories to their citizens about heading to the U.S. in response to various Trump policies.</p>



<p>Amid all this, travelers are increasingly turning away from the U.S., and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council said the U.S. economy is <a href="https://wttc.org/news/us-economy-set-to-lose-12-5bn-in-international-traveler-spend-this-year"  target="_blank">set to lose $12.5 billion</a> in international traveler spending this year.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s not much visitors can do if border officials want to deny them entry. You have the right to remain silent, an immigration lawyer told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/travel/us-border-crossing-international-visa.html"  target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>, but a border officer is likely to deny you entry as a result. And if they detain you instead of sending you back right away, they can hold you for up to 90 days.</p>



<p>Nate Freed Wessler, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/15/travel-trump-america-us-border-detentions"  target="_blank"><em>the Guardian</em></a> that after landing on an international flight but before clearing customs, you have fewer civil rights than you do elsewhere in the U.S. &ldquo;The normal Fourth Amendment requirement of a warrant or individualized suspicion doesn&rsquo;t apply,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The only minimal protection CBP has in their policy is distinguishing between manual and forensic searches,&rdquo; he added, explaining that a forensic search of a mobile phone, for example, involves plugging it into another device to analyze it, while a manual search includes scrolling through its contents. &ldquo;For a forensic search, they say they need reasonable suspicion, but they don&rsquo;t define what that means. For a manual search, there are no guardrails. They argue it&rsquo;s less invasive, but that&rsquo;s just not true. They can still do keyword searches and spend hours combing through your device.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Keep calm (but delete your nudes)&rdquo; advised <em>the Guardian</em>&rsquo;s headline for tourists headed to the U.S. <em>WIRED</em> has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-phone-searches-at-the-us-border/"  target="_blank">advised</a> traveling with a separate phone altogether&mdash;though a phone that appears &ldquo;too squeaky clean,&rdquo; it warns, &ldquo;can arouse suspicion&rdquo;&mdash;or at the very least minimizing risk by printing your boarding pass and any other documents you may need to present so you can avoid taking your phone out of your pocket.</p>



<p>Noor Zafar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU&rsquo;s Immigrants&rsquo; Rights Project, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/03/21/travelers-entering-united-states-rights/"  target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em> that travelers should keep the contact information of an immigration attorney in case they run into complications at the border.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The stories are definitely concerning,&rdquo; Zafar said in March. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re just in a period of more aggressive policies being implemented at the border. And I think that requires people to take extra precautionary measures.&rdquo;</p>
