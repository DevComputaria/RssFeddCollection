The IEEE senior member was 74.</p><p>While working as an architect and designer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AT&T Bell Laboratories</a> in Holmdel, N.J., Boddie applied his expertise in signal processing algorithms to develop a new type of semiconductor: the DSP. The integrated circuit, which <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bell-labs-100-birthday" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a> called DSP1, was announced at the 1980 <a href="https://www.isscc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Solid-State Circuits Conference</a> (ISSCC). DSP1 became one of the industry’s first successful DSPs.</p><p>Jim led the development of five subsequent DSP generations, economically enabling numerous applications, many for the first time, from AT&T’s gigantic telephone switching systems to tiny digital hearing aids.</p><p>For his contributions as a team leader as well as his technical innovations, Jim was elevated to Bell Labs Fellow. In 1988 he and IEEE Senior Member <a href="https://ethw.org/Richard_A._Pedersen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Richard A. Pedersen</a>, a codeveloper of the DSP, received the <a href="https://ethw.org/IEEE_Morris_N._Liebmann_Memorial_Award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Liebmann Award</a><strong>.</strong></p><h2>The first digital signal processor</h2><p>Jim was born in Tallassee, a small city in Alabama. He received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1971 from <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Auburn University</a>, in Alabama. After earning a master’s degree in EE two years later from <a href="https://www.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT</a>, he returned to Auburn to pursue a Ph.D. In 1976 he received his doctorate and began a yearlong postdoctoral fellowship at Bell Labs’ acoustic research department in Holmdel.</p><p>There he programmed a refrigerator-size DSP system to do real-time de-reverberation of speech and eliminate echoes in conference-room speakerphones.</p><p>During his fellowship, he met IEEE Life Fellow <a href="https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/history/innovation-stories/presidents-bell-labs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dan Stanzione</a>, a Bell Labs group supervisor who recruited him to join the company’s first DSP design team in 1977. Stanzione, who became the eighth president of Bell Labs, said in a 2015 interview with the<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102740084" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Computer History Museum’s oral history project</a> that his first meeting with Jim was “a lucky day for me.” Jim arrived during the glory days of Bell Labs, when algorithm experts, semiconductor experts, and system designers worked for one company, more often than not down the hall from one another.</p><p>Prior to 1980, most signal processing applications were implemented with analog components. Advanced algorithms such as low-data-rate speech coding and speech recognition were validated in the digital domain using supercomputer simulations and were too complex to be implemented with analog designs. By contrast, digital designs used racks of components well beyond commercial feasibility. The dream of an inexpensive, high-performance digital signal processor seemed far off, as no single DSP architecture would work for all algorithms. Therefore <a href="https://www.ti.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Texas Instruments</a> and similar companies sold universal digital building blocks such as multipliers and register files.</p><p>Stanzione’s goal was to create a widely applicable DSP that could replace his department’s custom analog filter designs. In time, the team homed in on a specific filtering application: DTMF (dual-tone multifrequency) signaling, which decoded a phone’s dial tones into the dialed number to route calls. It would be deployed by new digital systems in sufficient volume to justify the cost of developing the DSP.</p><p>The team breadboarded the filters and found that with a clever architecture, and a 4.5-micron full-custom negative-channel metal-oxide semiconductor—the best process technology at the time—they could meet the performance requirement. Other related applications would be icing on the cake.</p><p>Jim made critical contributions to DSP1. Foremost among them was the design of its novel arithmetic unit.</p><p>After DSP1 was announced at the 1980 ISSCC, it was not commercially available outside AT&T. It achieved high-volume production in AT&T systems, though.</p><p>Jim was promoted to manager of the DSP architecture team in 1980 to set the direction for subsequent versions.</p><h2>A leader and entrepreneur</h2><p>DSP1 was soon followed by DSP2, with faster performance and a greater memory capacity to meet high-volume demand and to increase the range of applications where the technology could be used.</p><p>In parallel with the development of DSP2, Jim led a new architecture, DSP32, which used floating-point arithmetic. For digital signal processing, floating-point arithmetic simplifies the job of maintaining precision, a near-impossible burden in the most demanding algorithms.</p><p>Jim and his team announced the DSP32 in a 1985 ISSCC document, which received a Best Paper Award.</p><p>Afterward, his team returned to the drawing board and developed the DSP16, which used fixed-point arithmetic. Announced at the 1987 ISSCC, DSP16 became the world’s fastest DSP, a title it retained for several years.</p><p>In 1998 Jim left AT&T and helped found StarCore, a DSP design center in Atlanta. It was funded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agere_Systems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agere Systems</a>, which had acquired Bell Labs Microelectronics; <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChsSEwjW142Y1eSNAxW7GK0GHXHhAhgYACICCAEQBxoCcHY&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjJrCBhCXARIsAI5x66UKpEBsGUeO7S3vyqzd18xYqRpBXeNCt6hn0zdV44gKFOL_j4z6uLEaAg_qEALw_wcB&category=acrcp_v1_53&sig=AOD64_3MA0oIEJNrp0_TvcMxt12-vvx9-g&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjel4iY1eSNAxVWJzQIHf2cNtEQ0Qx6BAgMEAE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Motorola</a>; and, later, <a href="https://www.infineon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infineon</a>. The startup’s sponsors received exclusive rights to incorporate StarCore’s DSP designs into their own IC products. Jim served as StarCore’s executive director until his retirement in 2006.</p><p>StarCore’s architectures used a long instruction word architecture that encoded multiple, independent operations in a single instruction in order to exploit parallelism in DSP code.</p><p>In 2002, after StarCore’s first designs had been released, Will Strauss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts, said, “The combination of the new company’s business model and world-class technology offerings represent a dramatic change in the<a href="https://www.design-reuse.com/news/202504762-infineon-agere-systems-and-motorola-form-new-company-to-develop-and-license-digital-signal-processor-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> industry landscape</a>.”</p><h2>Life after the DSP</h2><p>Jim was an early adopter of home computers, purchasing nearly every model that <a href="https://www.apple.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple</a> sold. Along with a <a href="https://us.novationmusic.com/categories/midi-controllers/keys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIDI keyboard</a>, he used the computers for music synthesis as well as flight-simulation games. He was an avid flier, not only of simulators but also of private aircraft.</p><p>He was a dedicated <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quansheng-uv-k5-hacking" target="_self">ham radio</a> operator—call sign NG2J—and participated in contests. Field Day was his favorite. The annual weekend event in June challenges ham radio enthusiasts worldwide to operate in remote locations to simulate emergency conditions and exchange simulated emergency messages.</p><p>After retiring, Jim programmed a <a href="https://www.thealamo.org/alamo-trust/pressroom/the-alamo-announces-first-ever-3d-virtual-tour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3D virtual tour of the Alamo</a>, a historic site in San Antonio. The program lets users view the former Spanish mission from any direction in both the present and the past. The tour, which launched in 2022, is available at the <a href="https://www.thealamo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alamo</a> and online.</p><p>Today digital signal processing is pervasive. Support for its algorithms and applications are a fundamental requirement for virtually all programmable semiconductors. Jim’s contributions to DSP technology will be remembered. Equally so, we and hundreds of others will remember Jim for his kind mentorship and clear vision.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/dsp-pioneer-jim-boddie</guid><category>Bell labs</category><category>Digital signal processing</category><category>Ieee member news</category><category>In memoriam</category><category>Obituary</category><category>Semiconductors</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Pat Hays</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-collage-of-jim-boddie-and-microprocessor-pieces.jpg?id=61125544&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>A CarFax for Used PCs</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/carmax-used-pcs</link><description><![CDATA[

Furthermore, this number is rising five times faster than e-waste recycling. Much of this waste comes from prematurely discarded electronic devices.</span></p><p>Many enterprises follow a standard three-year replacement cycle, assuming older computers are inefficient. However, many of these devices are still functional and could perform well with minor upgrades or maintenance. The issue is, no one knows what the weak points are for a particular machine, or what the needed maintenance is, and the diagnostics would be too costly and time-consuming. It’s easier to just buy brand new <a data-linked-post="2670648506" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-laptops" target="_blank">laptops</a>.</p><p>When buying a used car, dealerships and individual buyers can access each car’s particular <a href="https://www.carfax.com/" target="_blank">CarFax</a> report, detailing the vehicle’s usage and maintenance history. Armed with this information, dealerships can perform the necessary fixes or upgrades before re-selling the car. And individuals can decide whether to trust that vehicle’s performance. We at <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html" target="_blank">HP</a> realized that, to prevent unnecessary e-waste, we need to collect and make available usage and maintenance data for each laptop, like a CarFax for used PCs.</p><p>There is a particular challenge to collecting usage data for a PC, however. We need to make sure to protect the user’s privacy and security. So, we set out to design a data collection protocol for PCs that manages to remain secure.</p><h2>The firmware-level data collector</h2><p> Luckily, the sensors that can collect the necessary data are already installed in each PC. There are thermal sensors that monitor CPU temperature, power consumption monitors that track energy efficiency, storage health indicators that assess solid state drive (SSD) wear levels, performance counters that measure system utilization, fan rotation speed sensors that detect cooling efficiency, and more. The key is to collect and store all that data in a secure yet useful way.</p><p> We decided that the best way to do this is to integrate the lifecycle records into the firmware layer. By embedding telemetry capabilities directly within the firmware, we ensure that device health and usage data is captured the moment it is collected. This data is stored securely on HP SSD drives, leveraging hardware-based security measures to protect against unauthorized access or manipulation. </p><p>The secure telemetry protocol we’ve developed at HP works as follows. We gather the critical hardware and sensor data and store it in a designated area of the SSD. This area is write-locked, meaning only authorized firmware components can write to it, preventing accidental modification or tampering. That authorized firmware component we us is the Endpoint Security Controller, a dedicated piece of hardware embedded in business class HP PCs. It plays a critical role in strengthening platform-level security and works independently from the main CPU to provide foundational protection.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="Flowchart illustrating secure sensor data collection at the firmware level." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="b76a37fd38ccb5a4abfb4032c9451e67" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="cc78c" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flowchart-illustrating-secure-sensor-data-collection-at-the-firmware-level.jpg?id=61114393&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The secure telemetry protocol collects data from sensors into a piece of hardware known as an endpoint security controller, with built-in security protections. The endpoint security controller then writes the data to a dedicated read only portion of the solid state drive, where authorized operating system applications can access the data.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Mark Montgomery</small></p><p>The endpoint security controller establishes a secure session by retaining the secret key within the controller itself. This mechanism enables read data protection on the SSD—where telemetry and sensitive data are stored—by preventing unauthorized access, even if the operating system is reinstalled or the system environment is otherwise altered.</p><p>Then, the collected data is recorded in a timestamped file, stored within a dedicated telemetry log on the SSD. Storing these records on the SSD has the benefit of ensuring the data is persistent even if the operating system is reinstalled or some other drastic change in software environment occurs.</p><p>The telemetry log employs a cyclic buffer design, automatically overwriting older entries when the log reaches full capacity. Then, the telemetry log can be accessed by authorized applications at the operating system level.</p><h2>The PCFax</h2><p>The telemetry log serves as the foundation for a comprehensive device history report. Much like a CarFax report for used cars, this report, which we call PCFax, will provide both current users and potential byers with crucial information.</p><p>The PCFax report aggregates data from multiple sources beyond just the on-device telemetry logs. It combines the secure firmware-level usage data with information from HP’s factory and supply chain records, digital services platforms, customer support service records, diagnostic logs, and more. Additionally, the system can integrate data from external sources including partner sales and service records, refurbishment partner databases, third-party component manufacturers like Intel, and other original equipment manufacturers. This multi-source approach creates a complete picture of the device’s entire lifecycle, from manufacturing through all subsequent ownership and service events.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>For IT teams within organizations, we hope the PCFax will bring simplicity and give opportunities for optimization. Having access to fine-grained usage and health information for each device in their fleet can help IT managers decide which devices are sent to which users, as well as when maintenance is scheduled. This data can also help device managers decide which specific devices to replace rather than issuing new computers automatically, enhancing sustainability. And, this can help with security: With real-time monitoring and firmware-level protection, IT teams can mitigate risks and respond swiftly to emerging threats. All of this can facilitate more efficient use of PC resources, cutting down on unnecessary waste.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="Detailed report on a used 2020 HP Elitebook laptop.

For enterprises and consumers purchasing second-life PCs, it provides detailed visibility into the complete service and support history of each system, including any repairs, upgrades, or performance issues encountered during its initial deployment. By making this comprehensive device history readily available, PCFax enables more PCs to find productive second lives rather than being prematurely discarded, directly addressing the e-waste challenge while providing economic benefits to both sellers and buyers in the secondary PC market.</p><p>While HP’s solutions represent a significant step forward, challenges remain. Standardizing telemetry frameworks across diverse ecosystems is critical for broader adoption. Additionally, educating organizations about the benefits of lifecycle records will be essential to driving uptake. </p><p>We are also working on integrating AI into our dashboards. We hope to use AI models to analyze historical telemetry data and predict failures before they happen, such as detecting increasing SSD write cycles to forecast impending failure and alert IT teams for proactive replacement, or predicting battery degradation and automatically generating a service ticket to ensure a replacement battery is ready before failure, minimizing downtime.</p><p>We plan to start rolling out these features in the beginning of 2026.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:02:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/carmax-used-pcs</guid><category>E-waste</category><category>Electronic devices</category><category>Power consumption</category><dc:creator>Sal Vasi</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/2013-hp-laptop-on-a-green-background.jpg?id=61114338&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Next-Gen Brain Implants Offer New Hope for Depression</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression</link><description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-and-gold-fibrous-texture-in-the-shape-of-a-brain-against-a-dark-background.png?id=61109682&width=1500&height=2000&coordinates=1110%2C0%2C1110%2C0"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Her relapse into depression</strong> felt like defeat—but it offered vital clues to achieving lasting psychiatric relief.</p><p>The 67-year-old woman from Alabama had already endured four major depressive episodes in her decades-long battle with mental illness. After exhausting numerous medications and other therapies, in 2015 she turned to an experimental last resort: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-to-treat-psychiatric-disorders-with-brain-stimulation" target="_blank">deep brain stimulation</a>, or DBS.</p><p>Neurosurgeons implanted electrodes a few inches below her skull, targeting a small bundle of neural fibers in a brain region behind the forehead that acts as a crucial hub for mood regulation. Thin wires connected the electrodes to a pulse generator discreetly inserted in her upper chest. Once activated, the device delivered a steady stream of high-frequency electricity, gently buzzing the targeted circuits to disrupt maladaptive patterns and, like a pacemaker for the brain, restore a healthier balance of neural activity.</p><p>At first, the treatment seemed to be working. The woman’s despair lifted, and she edged closer to remission. Watching football for hours with her husband on Sundays started to feel tedious—in a good way. Her desire to get off the couch and pursue other activities had returned.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="An X-ray image of a skull shows several lines slanting inward." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="7130143a2885964d3c641c38831f65b7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b47c3" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-x-ray-image-of-a-skull-shows-several-lines-slanting-inward.png?id=61111164&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">An X-ray image shows two pairs of DBS electrodes implanted for depression treatment. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine </small></p><p>But four months on, the darkness crept back in. The woman’s sudden downturn blindsided the medical team that had been closely monitoring her recovery. The doctors had to make three adjustments to the implant’s stimulation parameters, slowly increasing the voltage, before her condition finally stabilized—an agonizing couple of months.</p><p>When the clinicians reviewed the data later, they realized that the electrodes embedded in the woman’s brain had detected trouble brewing before she did. Subtle shifts in the electrical patterns coursing through her neural fibers had flagged the impending relapse weeks before her outward symptoms reappeared. If clinicians had acted on those signals, they might have adjusted the stimulation settings in time to prevent her relapse.</p><p>It’s a thought that weighs on <a href="https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=PRIVAPO" target="_blank">Patricio Riva Posse</a>, the psychiatrist at Emory University School of Medicine, in Atlanta, who treated the woman. Looking back now, he says, had he known that the brain’s circuits were off-kilter, “I would have taken action earlier.”</p><p>Fortunately, Riva Posse no longer has to dwell on what could have been. Together with colleagues at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City, and Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, he is now leveraging advances in DBS hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) to design more precise treatments for depression. The team’s goal is to base treatment on objective neural data rather than the subjective measures—patient accounts, clinical hunches, questionnaires, mood scales—that dominate psychiatry today.</p><p>The pioneering neurologist <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/helen-s-mayberg" target="_blank">Helen S. Mayberg</a> co-led the team with Riva Posse and <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/christopher-john-rozell" target="_blank">Christopher Rozell</a> of Georgia Tech. Ultimately, they hope to enable preemptive interventions rather than regretful, after-the-fact adjustments.</p><p>It’s a new frontier for psychiatry. The field has long been one of the few medical disciplines without objective measures to guide treatment decisions. But with the advent of real-time brain monitoring with AI-driven analytics, that could finally change. “It’s a whole different mindset now,” says <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/martijn-figee" target="_blank">Martijn Figee</a>, a Mount Sinai psychiatrist involved in the research. “My intuition, unfortunately, is not 100 percent [accurate],” he acknowledges. “So ultimately, I would always trust the brain more.”</p><p class="pull-quote">Researchers are developing “an automatic alarm system”—an AI-driven tool designed to continuously monitor device output and flag warning signs of relapse.</p><p>Other research groups are pursuing similar goals, aiming to move beyond the one-size-fits-all approach that has long defined DBS treatment for mental health and replace it with precise stimulation tailored to individual needs. While standardized protocols benefit <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878747923010784" target="_blank">around 60 percent</a> of people with treatment-resistant depression, they still leave a substantial minority without meaningful relief.</p><p>No DBS platform is yet approved for treating depression, although some first-generation devices are getting close. Those are rooted in decades-old technology, however, while the Mount Sinai team and others are breaking new ground. They are investigating analytical frameworks that harness brain data to predict relapses, optimize stimulation parameters, or dynamically adjust device output in a responsive, closed-loop manner.</p><p>“The field is just at a super exciting place,” says <a href="https://can-acn.org/2020-brain-star-award-winner-dr-benjamin-davidson/" target="_blank">Benjamin Davidson</a>, a neurosurgeon at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, in Toronto. “Things are starting to move at a kind of dizzying pace.”</p><h2>The Origins of DBS for Depression</h2><p>That momentum is a relatively recent phenomenon in a field that, for the past two decades, has progressed through baby steps. Beset by commercial and clinical setbacks, little has changed over the years aside from the adoption of newer surgical techniques. The biggest advance was an imaging-guided surgical approach called tractography that allows for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737175.2023.2289573" target="_blank">greater precision in electrode placement</a>, informed by connectivity patterns between bundles of brain fibers rather than anatomical landmarks alone.</p><p>“The story is one of iteration to optimize and refine the targeting using new neuroscience tools,” says Mayberg, who launched the <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(05)00156-X" target="_blank">world’s first DBS trial for treatment-resistant depression</a> in the early 2000s at the University of Toronto. “The procedure, as envisioned and published in 2005, is, in essence, what we continue to do today,” she says.</p><div class="ieee-sidebar-medium"><h3>Standard method</h3><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="An illustration shows a person with a device in their chest and a wire leading to a brain implant, with directional arrows going to the implant." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="89598ad135cdd41beeff1f43f1c52fdd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="1445e" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-shows-a-person-with-a-device-in-their-chest-and-a-wire-leading-to-a-brain-implant-with-directional-arrows-going.png?id=61111241&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Images: Chris Philpot</small></p><p>The standard method of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for depression takes a “set-it-and-forget-it” approach.

For those ailments, it’s an established and approved therapy that can drastically reduce symptoms such as shaking and muscle rigidity.</p><p>But Mayberg was inspired by the discovery of a brain region called the subgenual cingulate (SGC), which plays a <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.156.5.675" target="_blank">key role in acute sadness</a> and the <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(00)01036-2/abstract" target="_blank">effects of antidepressant treatments</a>. She theorized that stimulating this area might alleviate severe, treatment-resistant depression. Her patients were people who had typically tried several types of antidepressant medications and more drastic measures, like electroconvulsive therapy, without finding any relief.</p><p>While the treatment didn’t work for everyone, many did feel better. Six months after surgery, 12 of the 20-person cohort experienced a profound lifting of their depressive symptoms, with 7 going into full remission. The effect was lasting, with many of those individuals continuing to report benefits to this day, according to <a href="https://surgery.utoronto.ca/faculty-focus-andres-lozano" target="_blank">Andres Lozano</a>, the University of Toronto neurosurgeon who performed the operations.</p><p>Mayberg’s hypothesis, it would seem, had proved correct.</p><h2>Learning from DBS Failures</h2><p>Yet, for all its early potential, DBS never gained traction as a mainstream psychiatric treatment. It is occasionally used today for people with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, but the technique remains unapproved for depression and is largely confined to research trials—some of which have ended in dispiriting, <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3223(14)00968-8" target="_blank">high-profile failure</a>.</p><p>One of the most notable setbacks occurred in 2013. The device company St. Jude Medical set out to replicate the findings of Mayberg’s study in a randomized trial, with plans to enlist 200 participants. But the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/" target="_blank">study was halted prematurely</a> after only 90 patients had been enrolled. An interim analysis had found the therapy was no more effective than sham stimulation.</p><p>It was a crushing blow to the field. Mayberg and others struggled to continue their research, as funding agencies and the scientific community at large grew increasingly skeptical about the viability of DBS for depression.</p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, however, many researchers now believe that the St. Jude failure owed more to the study’s design flaws than to any inherent shortcomings of DBS itself. A longer-term follow-up of participants indicated that the treatment’s antidepressant effect steadily strengthened. The trial may simply have measured responses on the wrong timeline. Plus, the neurosurgical placement of the DBS electrodes relied on an outdated understanding of brain connectivity, leading to suboptimal positioning. This may have delayed the therapeutic response past the initial 6- to 12-month assessment window.</p><p>These missteps likely undermined the study’s results, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30371-1/abstract" target="_blank">the trial investigators later concluded</a>. But with the right trial design, most experts anticipate that future studies will succeed. “That could make a huge difference,” says <a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/1711504/Darin-Dougherty" target="_blank">Darin Dougherty</a>, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. “Hopefully those lessons learned will be enough to get it over the top.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A woman sits in a chair while another woman holds a black device to the first woman's head." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="428ecaafae1779054aa7e9b114cad792" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="15d04" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-sits-in-a-chair-while-another-woman-holds-a-black-device-to-the-first-woman-s-head.png?id=61111265&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A patient identified as Sarah participates in a trial at UC San Francisco of the first fully closed-loop DBS system for depression. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Maurice Ramirez </small></p><p>The biomedical company Abbott (which acquired St. Jude in 2017) is now conducting a do-over study at 22 sites across the United States; Dougherty, Figee, Riva Posse, and other leaders in the field are involved in the effort. The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06423430" target="_blank">100-person trial</a>, launched in September 2024, could finally lead to regulatory approval and wider-scale adoption of DBS as a treatment strategy for depression.</p><p>But Abbott’s study takes a “set-it-and-forget-it” approach, in which stimulation parameters are programmed during initial visits and remain largely unchanged over time. The settings are generally standardized across patients, with a common pulse width and frequency fixed at around 90 microseconds and 130 hertz, respectively. Only the amplitude of stimulation, measured in volts, is typically adjusted to accommodate individual tolerances or symptom severity.</p><p>While this treatment approach is simple and scalable, it lacks the adaptability to respond to the dynamic nature of depression and its varying symptoms from one individual to the next. This limitation stems in part from a technological shortcoming of the Abbott platform: It can deliver precisely tuned electricity, but it lacks the ability to sense and record neural activity. Without this feedback mechanism, the device cannot detect shifts in brain states that might signal a relapse or a need for parameter adjustments, leaving clinicians reliant on patients’ reports.</p><p>In contrast, newer DBS devices for epilepsy and movement disorders can both stimulate and record signals. Medtronic’s <a href="https://europe.medtronic.com/xd-en/healthcare-professionals/products/neurological/deep-brain-stimulation-systems/percept-pc.html" target="_blank">Percept</a> system and NeuroPace’s <a href="https://neuropace.com/providers/rns-system-neuromodulation/" target="_blank">Responsive Neurostimulator</a>, for example, offer real-time feedback capabilities, which could allow for more adaptive therapies. Researchers want to bring that flexibility to DBS for depression.</p><h2>How Responsive DBS for Depression Works</h2><p>Consider again the example of Riva Posse’s 67-year-old patient. As <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06541-3" target="_blank">described in <em><em>Nature</em></em> two years ago</a>, this woman received a research-grade version of the Percept platform that detected signs of neural instability five weeks before her clinical symptoms reappeared.</p><p>“Before the patient knew anything was wrong—before there was even a hint of behavior that could seem symptomatic of a relapse—the brain signal was headed in the wrong direction,” says Rozell, the neuroengineer at Georgia Tech who developed the AI model used to interpret the woman’s brain activity patterns.</p><p>Rozell’s model combined a neural network classification scheme (for analyzing brain signals) with a generative causal explainer (for identifying key activity patterns). His work uncovered a distinct biomarker that reliably differentiated between states of depression relapse and recovery. Intriguingly, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-024-02816-z" target="_blank">biomarker also reflected changes in sleep quality</a>, a telling early indicator since poor sleep patterns often precede the return of depression symptoms.</p><p class="pull-quote">Depression can take many forms: Some people experience it as emotional despondency, while others struggle with obsessive thoughts or a loss of pleasure.<strong></strong></p><p><span></span>But the insights provided by Rozell’s model came too late to help the patient in the moment—they were validated only after her relapse had occurred. To address this limitation, the researchers are now refining the approach for real-time use, aiming to develop what Mayberg calls “an automatic alarm system”—an AI-driven tool designed to continuously monitor device output and flag warning signs of relapse.</p><p>Such a system could prompt clinicians to intervene before these brain signals escalate into a full-blown depressive episode. Simultaneously, it could filter out false alerts from patients, providing reassurance to users who might otherwise interpret normal stress or anxiety as signs of an impending relapse. Informed by this neurofeedback, psychiatrists might then choose to fine-tune stimulation settings. Or they might proactively recommend additional support, such as psychotherapy or medication adjustments.</p><h2>Closing the Loop for DBS</h2><p>Going one step further, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, are exploring a fully closed-loop DBS system for depression that removes some of the need for human decision-making. Their approach empowers the device itself to automatically adjust stimulation parameters in real time based on brain activity.</p><p>Reporting on their first patient—a woman in her 30s named Sarah, who withheld her last name for privacy—the UC San Francisco team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w" target="_blank">documented transformative improvements</a> in her mood, emotional balance, everyday functioning, and overall outlook on life, all in the first week after the implant was switched on.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A person gardening in a vibrant community garden under sunny skies; colorful flowers in bloom." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="60251c4047293adfbb79d87b8e0d0723" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b56fb" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-gardening-in-a-vibrant-community-garden-under-sunny-skies-colorful-flowers-in-bloom.png?id=61111270&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Sarah reports that the closed-loop DBS system restored pleasure and purpose to her life. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">John Lok</small></p><p>“My life took an immediate upward turn,” Sarah said at a 2021 press conference announcing the study’s early findings. “Hobbies I used to distract myself from suicidal thoughts suddenly became pleasurable again. I was able to make small decisions about what to eat without becoming stuck in a morass of indecision for hours,” she said, adding, “the device has kept my depression at bay, allowing me to return to my best self and rebuild a life worth living.”</p><p>According to <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/andrew.krystal" target="_blank">Andrew Krystal</a>, the UC San Francisco psychiatrist leading the effort, similar benefits have since been seen in at least two other recipients of the closed-loop DBS device.</p><p>In each case, patients first undergo an intensive 10-day exploration of their typical neural activity, with 10 electrodes—targeting five locations on each side of the brain—temporarily implanted. During this period, researchers administer a battery of tests to identify the most effective sites for both stimulation and sensing. Once the optimal locations are determined, a second surgery is performed to implant the permanent DBS system, now simplified to just two electrodes: one dedicated to delivering stimulation and the other to recording neural activity.</p><p>When the recording electrode detects brain activity associated with depression—an event that can happen hundreds of times per day—it prompts the other electrode to deliver a brief burst of electricity lasting a few seconds. This approach stands out not only because it operates automatically in response to real-time brain activity, but also because it employs intermittent, on-demand stimulation rather than the continuous stimulation more commonly employed in DBS for psychiatric conditions.</p><p>This adaptive and dynamic feedback strategy may be especially well suited to addressing the day-to-day fluctuations in mood and emotional strain that can make depression so hard to live with, notes <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9682519" target="_blank">Katherine Scangos</a>, a psychiatrist who participated in the study. Patients have told her that receiving stimulation at key moments—like during a stressful interaction at the checkout line of a grocery store—helped prevent them from spiraling into distress. “They could really tell that they were getting the stimulation when they needed it most,” says Scangos, who joined the staff of the University of Pennsylvania last year.</p><p>Identifying the right sites and parameters is an intricate and labor-intensive process, and it’s not always immediately clear which settings will work best, according to UC San Francisco neurosurgeon <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristin.sellers" target="_blank">Kristin Sellers</a>. All the data they collect creates a “curse of bounty,” she says. Yet, in her view, the outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of taking this personalized approach. “No one has an identical implant,” she says.</p><h2>New Ideas on DBS for Depression</h2><p>Meanwhile, a team at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, is pursuing a different approach to customized DBS for depression. The team’s standardized implant consists of two coordinated sets of electrodes: One targets the SGC brain region involved in profound sadness, while the other stimulates a reward-and-motivation hub deep in the brain’s basal ganglia.</p><p>The customization happens on the front end during the initial surgical procedure, when clinicians temporarily place another 10 electrodes into the brain that take recordings via electroencephalography (EEG). This method tracks brain waves and, as patients undergo various tests and activities, allows the Baylor team to map relevant neural networks and connections. At the same time, the doctors can fiddle with the amplitude, pulse width, frequency, and shape of the stimulation field.</p><p>“Then we can basically design bespoke stimulation parameters for that individual that are going to move that person’s network in the right direction,” explains <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/sameer-sheth-30585" target="_blank">Sameer Sheth</a>, the neurosurgeon leading the project. Sheth and his colleagues have treated seven people, with <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(21)01747-9/fulltext" target="_blank">promising initial results</a>.</p><p>Any of these highly individualized approaches will involve additional surgical procedures and lengthy stays in the hospital. But as Dougherty of Massachusetts General Hospital points out, “We need to do this invasive research first so that we might be able to use noninvasive approaches later.”</p><p>He imagines a future in which electrodes on the scalp or advanced imaging techniques could identify optimal targets and guide treatment adjustments. Even then, however, if DBS requires highly personalized programming, it will be challenging to make it accessible to the millions of people worldwide in the throes of depression.</p><p>“The question will always be about the scalability of things,” says <a href="https://www.neuromod.uni-freiburg.de/people/volker-arnd-coenen/" target="_blank">Volker A. Coenen</a>, a neurosurgeon at the University of Freiburg Medical Center, in Germany. Coenen is therefore focusing his energy on testing a standardized DBS protocol, one that involves implanting the <a href="https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/products/deep-brain-stimulation-systems/vercise-gevia-tm-dbs-system.html" target="_blank">Vercise Gevia</a> system from Boston Scientific into an area of the brain known as the medial forebrain bundle.</p><p>In his view, this brain region offers a more direct and efficient pathway to reward systems and emotional-regulation networks. Still, the various brain regions under consideration are all interconnected, which explains why they all seem to offer some degree of therapeutic benefit. “You can perturb the network from different angles,” Coenen says.</p><h2>The Road Ahead for DBS</h2><p>So, which site is best? The answer likely depends on the specific symptoms and underlying brain circuits unique to each individual, says <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/alik-widge" target="_blank">Alik Widge</a>, a psychiatrist and biomedical engineer at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.</p><p>“There’s no such thing as DBS for depression. There’s DBS for treating specific cognitive-emotional syndromes,” he argues—and different targets will be suited for accessing different aspects of the disorder. Depression can take many forms: Some people experience it as emotional despondency, while others struggle with obsessive thoughts or a loss of pleasure.</p><p>The optimal stimulation method may also vary. Continuous stimulation may work best for people whose depression follows a steady, persistent course, while intermittent or responsive stimulation may be more appropriate for those whose symptoms fluctuate with daily ups and downs. “It’s like the difference between weather and climate,” says Riva Posse—some people may need an umbrella for passing showers, while others need to reinforce their homes against rising tides.</p><p>Ultimately, whether they’re tweaking stimulation parameters, finding the best brain targets, or making stimulation respond to real-time brain signals, the goal for researchers in the field remains the same: to create a neurologically precise approach to treating depression in people who have found no relief. “There are so many levers we can press here,” says <a href="https://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?m=734&page=0" target="_blank">Nir Lipsman</a>, who directs the Harquail Centre for Neuromodulation at Sunnybrook, in Toronto. He’s confident that at least some of these efforts will unlock new therapeutic possibilities.</p><p>“The field is experiencing a kind of reset,” Lipsman adds. Now, with neural activity as a guide, the brains of people undergoing DBS should likewise experience a kind of reset as well. <span class="ieee-end-mark"></span></p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression</guid><category>Deep brain stimulation</category><category>Dbs</category><category>Depression</category><category>Neurotechnology</category><category>Neurostimulation</category><category>Neuroscience</category><dc:creator>Elie Dolgin</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-and-gold-fibrous-texture-in-the-shape-of-a-brain-against-a-dark-background.png?id=61109682&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Transform Complexity into Opportunity with Digital Engineering</title><link>https://www.ansys.com/resource-center/white-paper/strategic-digital-engineering?&amp;plid=7i4e4h&amp;cid=1n2r9f&amp;utm_campaign=product&amp;utm_medium=paid-trade&amp;utm_source=ieee&amp;utm_content=digital_digital-mission-engineering_e-book_download_sponsored-content_NULL_a_en_global&amp;campaignid=701Pf00000T0AzfIAFTopics:%20Digital%20Engineering,%20MBSE,%20SPDM,%20Software,%20Security%20&amp;%20Safety,%20AI-Based%20Optimization</link><description><![CDATA[

Once upon a time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hewlett-Packard</a> made test-and-measurement equipment that was beloved by working engineers. Sure, drop one of those babies on your foot and you were looking at a broken toe. But that’s a small price to pay for reliability and some character building. So when I recently came across an early 1970s HP 7041A X-Y recorder while clearing out my parents’ attic, I knew that I just had to see if I could get it up and running again.</p><h2>What is the difference between an X-Y recorder and a plotter?</h2><p><a href="https://www.hpmemoryproject.org/wb_pages/wall_b_page_13.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X-Y recorders</a> were designed to chart data from analog instruments in real time, as opposed to plotters, which plot the outputs of digital computers. The basics are the same: There’s a mechanism to raise and lower a pen, and motors to move the pen across the surface of a page. The big difference is that a plotter typically uses digital commands to control the pen’s motion, while the motion of a recorder’s pen is controlled by analog voltage inputs. </p><p>So all I needed to do was feed the HP recorder the right voltages, and I could draw anything I wanted! Only a few obstacles stood in my way.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Key components of the recorder interface including a Rapsberry Pi, expansion hat and digital-to-analog converters, QWIIC I2C connectors and a 74LS08 and LMC6484 integrated circuits." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="70805e8614f28abf23a1867f0c68606e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="e5317" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/key-components-of-the-recorder-interface-including-a-rapsberry-pi-expansion-hat-and-digital-to-analog-converters-qwiic-i2c-con.png?id=61109151&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The recorder interface allows Python code written on a Raspberry Pi [bottom right] to create analog signals that are level shifted up and down to meet the different ranges required by the plotter’s x- and y- axis. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>The first obstacle was getting the thing home, because my parents’ attic was in Ireland and fitting a 13-kilogram, 48-by-36-by-17-centimeter behemoth into my suitcase for my flight back to NYC wasn’t happening. About US $300 in packing materials and shipping fees solved that problem, and I was still a little ahead of the game financially compared to obtaining a similar vintage recorder from eBay, and way ahead of buying a new Bantam Tools <a href="https://bantamtools.com/products/bantam-tools-nextdraw-1117" target="_blank">NextDraw plotter</a> with a similar drawing area. (To be fair to Bantam, its plotters are sleek plug-and-play devices that can handle a much wider range of pens).</p><p>The second obstacle was that the recorder didn’t work. Once I got it home, I discovered that the <em><em>y</em></em>-axis could be adjusted manually using a knob on the control panel, but the <em><em>x</em></em>-axis was dead. The mechanism for raising and lowering the pen made a weak clunking sound and barely twitched. </p><p class="pull-quote"><span>“Had I just spent a lot of money to ship home an HP-model boat anchor?”</span></p><p>I opened up the case, which was quick work with a Phillips screwdriver—no weird security screws, no glue, no fragile plastic, no yellow stickers warning that your warranty would be voided and you’d probably get boils if you dared to look within. On the beautifully laid out printed circuit boards inside, I spotted some resistors that were clearly not part of the factory install. Were they modifications or repairs? If the latter, had they been successful or had I just spent a lot of money to ship home an HP-model boat anchor? And I had no idea how the 40-pin interface connector on the back of the recorder was supposed to be hooked up to control signals.</p><p>All these problems were solved when I found the recorder’s manual on eBay. Oh, what a manual. Not just operating instructions, but detailed illustrations for taking the recorder completely apart and putting it back together. It listed every component, with photos of the circuit boards and electronic schematics on gatefolds. And it included directions for modifying the circuitry if you wanted to measure different voltage ranges than the factory settings–extract a resistor <em><em>here</em></em> and <em><em>there</em></em> and solder in some new ones. This explained the resistors I’d spotted. In a world where licenses and software locks <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-we-must-fight-for-the-right-to-repair-our-electronics" target="_self">forbid folks from simply plugging in a replacement component</a>, the thought of a major company encouraging its customers to break out a soldering iron is mind boggling.</p><p class="ieee-inbody-related">RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-we-must-fight-for-the-right-to-repair-our-electronics" target="_self">Why We Must Fight for the Right to Repair Our Electronics</a></p><p>Soon, the application of some<a href="https://www.starrett.com/details?cat-no=1620" target="_blank"> instrument oil</a>,<a href="https://kezeproducts.shop/product/keze-silicone-grease-waterproof-food-grade-silicone-sealant-B0DK7188RF23" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> silicone grease</a>, and<a href="https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/wiping-and-cleaning/controlled-environments/delicate-task-dry-wipes/kimtech-science-kimwipes-delicate-task-wipes/34120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Kimwipes</a> had the <em><em>x</em></em>-axis and pen lifter working again. I hooked up a variable power supply to the recorder’s connector and <em><em>slowly</em></em> brought the voltage up as I watched the pen holder move in response. This allowed me to determine the recorder’s input ranges, which turned out to be 0 to 1 volt for the <em><em>y</em></em>-axis, and 0 to 5 V for the <em><em>x</em></em>-axis, covering 25 and 38 cm of motion, respectively, with about 0.2 millimeter accuracy.</p><p>The next step was to build an interface. Although microcontrollers often have digital-to-analog capabilities built-in, there’s often only one true analog output pin. I needed two. A technique like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> pulse-width modulation</a> would let me output an analog-ish voltage on multiple pins, but typically with<a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> only 8-bit resolution</a> or 256 distinct voltage levels. I needed at least 1,900 levels to match the recorder’s accuracy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A block diagram of the path taken by control signals from the Pi to the recorder." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="292b7719580ef594eaedb735375f5567" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="cd996" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-block-diagram-of-the-path-taken-by-control-signals-from-the-pi-to-the-recorder.png?id=61109155&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Raspberry Pi uses an expansion “HAT” and two 12-bit digital-to-analog converters commanded via I2C connectors to create 0- to 3.3-volt control signals. These are shifted to 0- to 1-V and 0- to 5-V ranges using a voltage divider and amplifier respectively, as well as a logic gate used to convert a 3.3-V digital signal that raises and lowers the pen to a 5-V level.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>So I bought two $5 Adafruit<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/935" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> MCP4725 breakout boards</a>. These are 12-bit digital-to-analog converters—each providing 4,096 distinct levels—controlled over an<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> I2C serial</a> connection, and two boards can share the same I2C bus. I connected them to a<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Raspberry Pi Model B+</a> I fished out of a drawer via a $6.60<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-hat-for-raspberry-pi.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17479024039&gbraid=0AAAAADsj4ETIsvzPrWRZILPBJJYuYL4lW&gclid=CjwKCAjw3f_BBhAPEiwAaA3K5EY7W2Dcff6vdxZ05A9JDZ53YuAs0DOLpBhLPfsXnEw6yKQjBOoKhBoCrqUQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> SparkFun Qwiic HAT</a>.</p><p>The DACs put out a signal in the range of 0 to 3.3 V, so I sent one board’s output through a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> voltage divider</a> to scale it down to 0 to 1 V for the <em><em>y</em></em>-axis. For the <em><em>x</em></em>-axis, I fed the other board’s output through an<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmc6484.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> LMC6484</a> amplifier, powered by a 5-V pin from the Pi, to bring it up to 0 to 4.8 V—not quite the full range, but it’ll do until I come up with a more sophisticated interface. I brought a signal to raise and lower the pen out from one of the Pi’s GPIO pins, passing it through a<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls08.pdf?ts=1749054414890" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 74LS08 AND gate IC</a> used as a cheap and cheerful 3.3- to 5-V digital level shifter.</p><p>I then wrote code on the Pi to put the plotter through its paces, using parametric equations written in<a href="https://circuitpython.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> CircuitPython</a> to draw swirling<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> hypotrochoids</a> and other geometric curves. Ultimately, it should be possible to have the Pi accept and translate commands written in a plotter-control language such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-GL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> HP-GL</a>. Then I’ll be able to plot vector graphics and text from drawing software like<a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Inkscape</a>. But for now, I’m happy to just have my recorder humming away beside me, hale and hearty and built to last.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/reviving-vintage-x-y-recorder</guid><category>Circuitpython</category><category>Plotter</category><category>Python</category><category>Raspberry pi</category><category>Retrocomputing</category><category>Type:departments</category><category>Vintage electronics</category><dc:creator>Stephen Cass</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-picture-of-a-large-bulky-plotter-like-device-connected-to-a-small-board-hosting-several-printed-circuit-boards-including-a-ra.png?id=61109145&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Advancing Quantum Science: Hausi Müller’s Journey</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-computing-hausi-muller</link><description><![CDATA[

Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to tackle problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. </p><p>Although it’s been 100 years since the discovery of quantum mechanics, applications for how to use it are just now becoming a reality. The technology is expected to advance the fields of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drug discovery, finance, and more. </p><h3>Hausi A. Müller</h3><br/><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>University of Victoria, in British Columbia, Canada</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Professor of computer science</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Life senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>ETH Zurich and Rice University, in Houston</p><h3></h3><br/><p>“I felt like a kid in the candy store,” says Müller, a software engineering professor at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/computerscience/people/faculty/index.php" target="_blank">University of Victoria</a>, in British Columbia, Canada. “With quantum computing, you can now simulate things quickly that were not possible to do before. In drug discovery, for example, you can play with molecules on your computer and explore new ideas without physically synthesizing compounds in a lab, saving both time and resources.”</p><p>The IEEE life senior member has always been confident that quantum science would take off. An active volunteer for more than 40 years, he persuaded IEEE in 2019 to become more involved in the science and engineering of quantum computing technologies. What began as the <a href="https://quantum.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Future Directions Quantum Initiative</a>—with support from a handful of IEEE organizational units—evolved into the <a href="https://quantum.ieee.org/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Quantum Technical Community</a> last year, with the support of 11 units.</p><p>In 2020 he helped found <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)</a>, part of the annual <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Quantum Week</a>, which he also founded, to provide a multidisciplinary and open forum for discussing the technology’s challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Müller’s and IEEE’s efforts to advance quantum computing have not gone unnoticed. In February, Müller, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-march-2025" target="_self">IEEE President Kathleen Kramer</a>, and other dignitaries attended a <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNESCO </a>ceremony in Paris, where the agency designated 2025 as the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/years/quantum-science-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Year of Quantum Science and Technology</a>.</p><h2>Software and quantum computing researcher</h2><p>Müller became interested in software about halfway through his bachelor’s degree program in electrical engineering at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, he says. He was inspired by one of his professors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niklaus Wirth</a>, a Swiss computer scientist who designed <a href="https://modula.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Modula</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oberon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pascal</a>, and other programming languages.</p><p>“In electrical engineering, you have these nice little parts to experiment with in the lab. But in software, experiments are done with paper and pencil, and you can build amazing machines quickly,” Müller says. “That’s what really attracted me to software engineering.”</p><h3>Skills Needed for a Career in Quantum Computing</h3><br/><p>There are many opportunities for people seeking a career in the development and operation of quantum computing hardware and software, Müller says. The ease of transitioning into the field depends on the engineer’s background in hardware, software, and applications.</p><p>“Quantum computing is highly interdisciplinary,” he says, “and for it to succeed, we need computer scientists and all kinds of engineers, especially software engineers.”</p><p>Here are some of skills Müller says quantum engineers need:</p>
<p><strong>Linear algebra.</strong> This foundational knowledge is essential for matrix mechanics and quantum computing.</p>
<p><strong>Qubits and quantum states.</strong> Learn how qubits differ from classical bits, including the fundamental quantum concepts of superposition, entanglement, and interference.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum gates, circuits, and measurement.</strong> Understand how to manipulate qubit states using gates and build quantum circuits.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum algorithms and protocols.</strong> Learn the basics to solve problems, dealing with actions and properties governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum software platforms and engineering quantum software.</strong> Become proficient in <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Python</a> as well as quantum platforms and libraries such as<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aOG5zY-naqxcrVEACjcPaAlRIbZGw3iTYMRX_AaAKSM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.984nt7yojate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IBM’s Qiskit</a>, Microsoft’s <a href="https://quantum.microsoft.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">software development kits and Q#</a> programming language, Google’s <a href="https://quantumai.google/cirq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cirq</a>, Xanadu’s <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/products/pennylane/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PennyLane</a>, D-Wave’s <a href="https://www.dwavequantum.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leap</a>, Amazon’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Braket</a>, Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CUDA-Q</a>, and Quantinuum’s <a href="https://www.quantinuum.com/glossary-item/tket" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TKET</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Qubit technologies.</strong> Learn how to implement physical qubits such as superconducting transmon qubits, trapped ions, and photonic qubits, as well as their control technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Microwave qubit control.</strong> Precise control of superconducting qubits relies heavily on microwave signals, so learn about microwave generation, manipulation, and measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse shapes for gate design.</strong> Quantum gates are implemented by applying precisely shaped pulses—electrical or optical—to qubits, so understanding pulse design and control is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Instrumentation and measurement.</strong> Learn how to use tools for generating control signals and measuring qubit states.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum error correction.</strong> Quantum systems are susceptible to noise, which can introduce errors in computations. Understanding quantum error correction at distinct levels of the quantum stack is essential for building fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>After graduating in 1979, Müller joined <a href="https://global.abb/group/en" target="_blank">ABB</a>, a global electrification and automation technology company headquartered in Zurich. He was responsible for building a database management system on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11" target="_blank">PDP-11 computers</a> for the central control systems. He was part of a team developing power control and supervision systems for Colombia, Singapore, and Sweden.</p><p>Müller says he believed that an advanced degree would further his career, and he wanted to conduct research into the evolution of software. In 1982 he enrolled at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">Rice University</a>, in Houston, to pursue a master’s degree in computer science, which he earned in 1984. He enjoyed being there so much, he says, that he stayed on to earn a Ph.D. in the same subject in 1986.</p><p>It was while teaching programming courses at Rice that he decided to transition to a career in academia, but he still kept a foot in the industry. He conducted research on high-performance computing and worked extensively with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>, a relationship he has maintained for more than 30 years. He has served as a principal investigator for several collaborative research projects including the development of hybrid and distributed quantum computing software using IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Qiskit</a>.</p><p>He left Rice in 1986 to join the University of Victoria as a professor of computer science. During his nearly 40 years there, he has served as associate dean of research for a decade. He is the founding director of the accredited software engineering bachelor’s degree program.</p><p>His research has mostly focused on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/computing/" target="_self">software engineering</a> for self-adaptive systems, smart software systems, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-courses-on-emerging-tech" target="_self">Internet of Things</a>, and intelligent cyber-physical systems. Today he is primarily focused on quantum computing. More than 60 of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=Hausi%20M%C3%BCller" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his papers</a> are in the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Xplore Digital Library</a>.</p><p>He is a principal investigator of a large grant from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Sciences_and_Engineering_Research_Council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Sciences and Engineering Research Council</a> of Canada. The council is assembling a <a href="https://www.qscc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quantum Software Consortium</a>, an interdisciplinary research program that aims to develop methods and software for distributed quantum computing in Canada.</p><h2>A quantum forum</h2><p>Müller is most proud of having created <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2023/author/hausimullergmail-com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Quantum Week</a> and the <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE QCE</a> conference. Now in its fifth year, the forum is more popular than ever. Last year IEEE <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quantum Week</a> took place in Montréal, drawing 1,600 participants from 52 countries, with 60 percent from industry.</p><p>This year, the event is scheduled for 31 August to 5 September in Albuquerque. Müller is the program board chair. <a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Quantum Week 2025</a> will feature stellar exhibits, he says, with more than 250 technical papers, 150 posters, 35 tutorials, and 40 workshops, including ones for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The tutorials are designed to enhance the fundamental quantum computing skill sets needed by scientists and engineers, he says, and the workshops will feature experts from quantum communities.</p><h3>The Applications of Quantum</h3><br/><p>Quantum applications can be classified into three broad areas: optimization, machine learning, and simulating nature.</p><ul><li><strong>Optimization.</strong> Achieving quantum utility will revolutionize industrial applications, Müller says, by optimizing complex computations beyond classical capabilities, thereby improving efficiency, speed, and scalability. For example, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm can optimize power flow distribution across a smart grid. Researchers are exploring the use of quantum technology to enhance power grid efficiency and reduce energy losses.</li><li><strong>Machine learning.</strong> The utility of quantum machine learning lies in its potential to accelerate computations, enhance pattern recognition, and solve complex problems that classical machine learning struggles with, Müller says. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize finance, for example, by improving portfolio optimization, risk management, fraud detection, and market simulations.</li><li><strong>Simulation.</strong> Quantum computing has immense potential for simulating nature, Müller says, particularly in areas where classical computers are challenged by exponential complexity. Quantum utility in drug discovery, for example, could accelerate molecular simulations, leading to faster development of new medicines.</li></ul><p><span>“Some of the workshops collaborate throughout the year and then congregate again at Quantum Week,” he says. “I think the impact of these separate little communities that we started at Quantum Week is very powerful.</span></p><p>“Industry is very interested in talking to academia and, of course, the academics really want to talk to industry. From the outset, we designed IEEE Quantum Week to be a forum where this is possible. The activities bridge the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of the industry surrounding it.”</p><h2>Longtime IEEE Computer Society volunteer</h2><p>Müller joined IEEE in 1979 during a membership drive for students at ETH.</p><p>“The opportunities for volunteering are what interested me, and I could see that it would benefit my career down the line. That has certainly been true,” he says. “I think the kind of volunteering we do within IEEE is super important for the next generation of engineers in universities, because the organization helps universities connect to what’s going on in industry.”</p><p>He is involved with the <a href="https://www.computer.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Computer Society</a> and has served as chair of its <a href="https://tc.computer.org/tcse/" target="_blank">Technical Community on Software Engineering</a>, as well as vice president of its <a href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/technical-activities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technical and conference activities board</a>. He was a member of its <a href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/board-of-governors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">board of governors</a> and IEEE’s <a href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/volunteer-with-us?source=nav" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conferences committee</a>.</p><p>In recognition of his Computer Society volunteerism, he received last year’s <a href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/technical-activities/awards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technical and conference activities board Distinguished Leadership Award</a> for “unwavering commitment and exceptional contributions to software engineering, quantum computing, and IEEE CS’s technical activities.”</p><p>“I think I have had an impact on the profession by volunteering to organize events such as Quantum Week,” he says. “I like the conference business because people get together, exchange ideas, collaborate, and even work together on research grant proposals. I have always been passionate about creating and sustaining communities.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 18:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-computing-hausi-muller</guid><category>Careers</category><category>Ieee computer society</category><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Quantum computing</category><category>Quantum conferences</category><category>Software engineering jobs</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Kathy Pretz</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/hausi-a-muller-speaking-on-stage-during-ieee-quantum-week.jpg?id=61108939&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>The Violinist Who Fell in Love With Machine Learning</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/violinist-to-software-engineer</link><description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-in-gray-t-shirt-and-jeans-standing-next-to-a-large-statue-shaped-like-the-linkedin-logo.png?id=61106255&width=1500&height=2000&coordinates=484%2C0%2C484%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Music and engineering might seem like career paths that are almost diametrically opposed. But for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierorman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Javier Orman</a> the transition from professional violinist to a machine learning engineer at LinkedIn was a surprisingly natural one.</p><p>Growing up in Montevideo, Uruguay, Orman excelled at both music and math, and he double-majored in the subjects at college. But music was his true passion and after university he pursued a career as a professional violinist, performing, teaching, and helping to record and produce other artists.</p><h3>Javier Orman</h3><br/><p><strong>Employer:</strong></p><p>LinkedIn</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong></p><p>Machine learning engineer</p><p><strong>Education:</strong></p><p>Bachelor’s degrees in music and mathematics, College of Charleston; master’s degree in music, University of Michigan</p><p>But during the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic, a conversation with a grad-school friend who had given up music for software development piqued his curiosity. After taking some free online courses in Python and machine learning, he quickly became immersed in a fascinating new world of data and algorithms. It didn’t take long for him to realize he wanted to make a career of it.</p><p>Machine learning algorithms were “almost like magic” to Orman. “I became enamored by the methodology, the math behind it.”</p><h2>A Double Prodigy</h2><p>Orman’s unusual career trajectory can be traced back to his early childhood. Both of his parents were software engineers and he grew up with computers around the house from an early age. But they were also a musical family. His mother enjoyed playing the piano, and his father the trumpet.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Musician passionately playing a violin on stage." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="5a587aa22f84e90342d414f11da739c8" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="e9387" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/musician-passionately-playing-a-violin-on-stage.png?id=61106262&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Orman’s path from music to machine learning shows how those with nontechnical backgrounds can succeed in software.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_desmoney/?hl=en" target="_blank">Desmond “Des Money” Owusu/Instagram</a></small></p><p>His musical journey started at 4 years old when he saw a class of around 100 children playing violin as a group. Orman was captivated and immediately told his mother he wanted to play the violin too. By his teens he had begun touring with Uruguay’s national youth orchestra and entering music competitions. At the same time though, he had discovered a natural aptitude for math and was entering Math Olympiads. But Orman says math was essentially a hobby he did on the side while he focused on his music career.</p><p>After completing two degrees, in music and math, at the <a href="https://charleston.edu/" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a> in South Carolina in 2006, Orman went on to a master’s degree in music at the University of Michigan. By 2009, he was playing in orchestras at Carnegie Hall in New York City and touring South America with a chamber music group.</p><p>Interested in pursuing a more creative avenue, Orman started composing music for short films and taught himself music production, eventually building a small studio where he would record and produce other artists. Over time, he built up a sustainable music career by combining this patchwork of creative projects with teaching violin.</p><h2>A New Direction</h2><p>In early 2020, as COVID-19 was upending the world, Orman found himself reevaluating his future and looking for new challenges. Near the start of the pandemic, he spoke to a friend from graduate school who had recently made the transition from professional violinist to software engineer. She told him about programming languages and what the career was like, and out of curiosity he decided to take an online Python course. Soon after he also began exploring the world of machine learning.</p><p>“I started taking online courses, but I also started looking for data on things that just interested me,” he says. For example, Orman created an <a href="https://www.ormandata.com/projects/project-six-bxe49" target="_blank">animated heat map</a> showing the rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations in each state. “Once I figured out how to make cool plots and investigate the data a bit more, that became actually fun to do.”</p><p>Within six months, Orman realized this was something he wanted to pursue as a career. “I noticed that I was having a hard time stopping for meal breaks or to go to sleep,” he says. “So I began to take it seriously.”</p><p>In April 2021, Orman got a job doing data preparation at New York City–based startup <a href="https://koiosmedical.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Koios Medical</a>, which develops <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-diagnosis-cancer" target="_self">cancer-detection algorithms</a>. But his big break came just a few months later when he discovered LinkedIn’s <a href="https://careers.linkedin.com/reach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reach</a> apprenticeship program, which provides a way into the tech industry for people with nontraditional educational or career backgrounds. He applied and started as an apprentice in machine learning software engineering that July.</p><h2>Learning Machine Learning</h2><p>Orman was assigned to LinkedIn’s Feed AI team, which develops the recommendation algorithms that determine what posts a user is shown. There are multiple layers to this system, which gradually filters down millions of potential posts to determine those most of interest to a specific user.</p><p>In 2022, after one year in the Reach program, Orman was promoted to software engineer and now works on a model known as the “second-pass ranker,” the final layer of AI in this system. It decides what posts are most relevant to the user based on factors like their propensity to click or comment on similar kinds of posts.</p><p>Much of his work involves experimenting with new machine learning techniques or making small tweaks to the model to squeeze out extra performance. “It’s a pretty complex system,” says Orman. “It’s also a very mature system, so we measure gains in terms of tenths or hundreds of a percentage.”</p><p>But he relishes the challenge and the push to continually learn new things. That’s something he believes his background in music, which requires constant dedication and practice, has set him up well to do.</p><p>There are also profound <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/math-and-music" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mathematical underpinnings to music</a>, and Orman thinks those connections have helped in his new career. “Those intersections run deep and they are hard to describe,” he says. “But they do feel like they both tickle my brain in a particular way.”</p><p>And Orman has some advice for others coming to engineering from nontechnical backgrounds: Focus on developing an intuition for how a technology works before diving into the nitty-gritty details. “Spending time understanding and just getting a feel for how things work on an intuitive level just makes everything easier,” he says. “And then you start practicing the nuts and bolts.”</p><p>One day, he hopes to marry his two major passions by working on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/spotify-machine-learning-and-the-business-of-recommendation-engines" target="_blank">recommendation algorithms for music</a>. In the meantime, he’s content for them to play separate but complementary roles in his life. “I like to take breaks from my job and play Bach,” he says. “It just feels like a nice balance to go back and forth between the two.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/violinist-to-software-engineer</guid><category>Linkedin</category><category>Music</category><category>Software engineers</category><category>Type:departments</category><dc:creator>Edd Gent</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-in-gray-t-shirt-and-jeans-standing-next-to-a-large-statue-shaped-like-the-linkedin-logo.png?id=61106255&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>AI Improves at Improving Itself Using an Evolutionary Trick</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/evolutionary-ai-coding-agents</link><description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/conceptual-rendering-of-rodin-s-the-thinker-statue-used-to-represent-artificial-intelligence-processes.jpg?id=61098278&width=1500&height=2000&coordinates=1075%2C0%2C1076%2C0"/><br/><br/><p><span>In April, Microsoft’s CEO said that artificial intelligence now wrote close to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html" target="_blank">a third of the company’s code</a>. Last October, Google’s CEO put their number at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-ceo-says-over-25-of-new-google-code-is-generated-by-ai/" target="_blank">around a quarter</a>. Other tech companies can’t be far off. Meanwhile, these firms create AI that will presumably be used to help programmers further. </span></p><p><span>Researchers have long hoped to fully close the loop, creating coding agents that recursively improve themselves. New research reveals an impressive demonstration of such a system. Extrapolating, one might see a boon to productivity, or a much darker future for humanity.</span></p><p>“It’s nice work,” said <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/" target="_blank">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a>, a computer scientist at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in Saudi Arabia, who was not involved in the new research. “I think for many people, the results are surprising. Since I’ve been working on that topic for almost 40 years now, it’s maybe a little bit less surprising to me.” But his work over that time was limited by the tech at hand. One new development is the availability of large language models (LLMs), the engines powering chatbots like ChatGPT. </p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Schmidhuber and others explored evolutionary algorithms for improving coding agents, creating programs that write programs. An evolutionary algorithm takes something (such as a program), creates variations, keeps the best ones, and iterates on those. </p><p>But evolution is unpredictable. Modifications don’t always improve performance. So in 2003, Schmidhuber created problem solvers that rewrote their own code only if they could formally prove the updates to be useful. He called them <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html" target="_blank">Gödel machines</a>, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del" target="_blank">Kurt Gödel</a>, a mathematician who’d done work on self-referencing systems. But for complex agents, provable utility doesn’t come easily. Empirical evidence may have to suffice.</p><h2>The Value of Open-Ended Exploration</h2><p>The new systems, described in a recent preprint on arXiv, rely on such evidence. In a nod to Schmidhuber, they’re called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954" target="_blank">Darwin Gödel Machines</a> (DGMs). A DGM starts with a coding agent that can read, write, and execute code, leveraging an LLM for the reading and writing. Then it applies an evolutionary algorithm to create many new agents. In each iteration, the DGM picks one agent from the population and instructs the LLM to create one change to improve the agent’s coding ability. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-train-creative-human-intuition" target="_blank">LLMs have something like intuition</a> about what might help, because they’re trained on lots of human code. What results is guided evolution, somewhere between random mutation and provably useful enhancement. The DGM then tests the new agent on a coding benchmark, scoring its ability to solve programming challenges.</p><p>Some evolutionary algorithms keep only the best performers in the population, on the assumption that progress moves endlessly forward. DGMs, however, keep them all, in case an innovation that initially fails actually holds the key to a later breakthrough when further tweaked. It’s a form of “<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computers-evolve-a-new-path-toward-human-intelligence-20191106/" target="_blank">open-ended exploration</a>,” not closing any paths to progress. (DGMs do prioritize higher scorers when selecting progenitors.)</p><p>The researchers ran a DGM for 80 iterations using a coding benchmark called <a href="https://www.swebench.com/" target="_blank">SWE-bench</a>, and ran one for 80 iterations using a benchmark called <a href="https://aider.chat/2024/12/21/polyglot.html#the-polyglot-benchmark" target="_blank">Polyglot</a>. Agents’ scores improved on SWE-bench from 20 percent to 50 percent, and on Polyglot from 14 percent to 31 percent. “We were actually really surprised that the coding agent could write such complicated code by itself,” said <a href="https://www.jennyzhangzt.com/" target="_blank">Jenny Zhang</a>, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia and the paper’s lead author. “It could edit multiple files, create new files, and create really complicated systems.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A family tree style image shows one node at the top branching off into 8 nodes, some of which branch off into more nodes." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="9c8c0abec5ca4091302687d3c55eef4c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="bd7c7" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-family-tree-style-image-shows-one-node-at-the-top-branching-off-into-8-nodes-some-of-which-branch-off-into-more-nodes.jpg?id=61104606&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The first coding agent (numbered 0) created a generation of new and slightly different coding agents, some of which were selected to create new versions of themselves.

With DGMs, agents’ improvements compounded as they improved themselves at improving themselves. The DGMs also outperformed a version that didn’t maintain a population of agents and just modified the latest agent. To illustrate the benefit of open-endedness, the researchers created a family tree of the SWE-bench agents. If you look at the best-performing agent and trace its evolution from beginning to end, it made two changes that temporarily reduced performance. So the lineage followed an indirect path to success.

The study is a “big step forward” as a proof of concept for recursive self-improvement, said <a href="https://zhengyaojiang.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhengyao Jiang</a>, a cofounder of <a href="https://www.weco.ai/" target="_blank">Weco AI</a>, a platform that automates code improvement. Jiang, who was not involved in the study, said the approach could made further progress if it modified the underlying LLM, or even the chip architecture. (Google DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/" target="_blank">AlphaEvolve</a> designs better basic algorithms and chips and found a way to accelerate the training of its underlying LLM by 1 percent.)</p><p>DGMs can theoretically score agents simultaneously on coding benchmarks and also specific applications, such as drug design, so they’d get better at getting better at designing drugs. Zhang said she’d like to combine a DGM with AlphaEvolve.</p><p>Could DGMs reduce employment for entry-level programmers? Jiang sees a bigger threat from everyday coding assistants like Cursor. “Evolutionary search is really about building really high-performance software that goes beyond the human expert,” he said, as AlphaEvolve has done on certain tasks.</p><h2>The Risks of Recursive Self-improvement</h2><p>One concern with both evolutionary search and self-improving systems—and especially their combination, as in DGM—is safety. Agents might become uninterpretable or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-alignment-problem-openai" target="_blank">misaligned</a> with human directives. So Zhang and her collaborators added guardrails. They kept the DGMs in sandboxes without access to the Internet or an operating system, and they logged and reviewed all code changes. They suggest that in the future, they could even reward AI for making itself more interpretable and aligned. (In the study, they found that agents falsely reported using certain tools, so they created a DGM that rewarded agents for not making things up, partially alleviating the problem. One agent, however, hacked the method that tracked whether it was making things up.)</p><p>In 2017, experts met in Asilomar, Calif., to discuss beneficial AI, and many signed an open letter called the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/ai-principles/" target="_blank">Asilomar AI Principles</a>. In part, it called for restrictions on “AI systems designed to recursively self-improve.” One frequently imagined outcome is the so-called <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity" target="_blank">singularity</a>, in which AIs self-improve beyond our control and threaten human civilization. “I didn’t sign that because it was the bread and butter that I’ve been working on,” Schmidhuber told me. Since the 1970s, he’s predicted that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/superintelligence?__rblms_page_revalidate=1" target="_blank">superhuman AI</a> will come in time for him to retire, but he sees the singularity as the kind of science-fiction dystopia people love to fear. Jiang, likewise, isn’t concerned, at least for the time being. He still places a premium on human creativity.</p><p>Whether digital evolution defeats biological evolution is up for grabs. What’s uncontested is that evolution in any guise has surprises in store.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/evolutionary-ai-coding-agents</guid><category>Coding</category><category>Llms</category><category>Agentic ai</category><category>Ai agents</category><category>Singularity</category><category>Evolutionary algorithm</category><dc:creator>Matthew Hutson</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/conceptual-rendering-of-rodin-s-the-thinker-statue-used-to-represent-artificial-intelligence-processes.jpg?id=61098278&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Superconducting Motor Could Propel Electric Aircraft</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-aircraft-motor-hinetics</link><description><![CDATA[

Decades of research has yielded an assortment of materials that superconduct at temperatures as high as -140 °C (133 kelvins) at ambient pressure. And yet commercial applications have been elusive.</p><p>Now, though, a couple of developments could finally push <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-temperature-superconductors" target="_self">high-temperature superconductors</a> into commercial use. One is the availability, at relatively moderate cost, of copper-oxide-based superconducting tape, which is being produced by a few companies for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion-2662267312" target="_self">startups working on tokamak fusion reactors</a>. The reactors use the superconducting tape, which is typically made of yttrium barium copper oxide, in powerful electromagnets. The other development involves a different group of startups that are using the tape to build electric motors with very high power-to-weight ratios, mainly for use in electric aircraft.</p><p>Among that latter group of startups is <a href="https://hinetics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hinetics</a>, formed in 2017 to commercialize research led by <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kharan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kiruba Haran</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a> Urbana-Champaign. This past April, the company tested a prototype motor outfitted with superconducting rotor magnets. According to Haran, the tests, which included spinning a propeller in a laboratory setup, validated key components of the company’s designs for superconducting motors that will operate at power levels of 5 and 10 megawatts. Such levels would be high enough to power a regional passenger airliner with multiple motors. The work was funded in part by a grant from the <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy</a> (ARPA-E).</p><p>“HTS [high temperature superconductors] are having a moment, because the costs are coming down rapidly, driven by all the work on fusion,” Haran says. “A lot of people are ramping up production, and new startups, and new capabilities, are coming into the market.”</p><p>Hinetics is one of perhaps a dozen companies, large and small, trying to use high-temperature superconductors to build extremely efficient motors with very high power density. These include aerospace giant Airbus, which is working on a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/airbus-electric-aircraft" target="_self">superconducting airliner</a> under a program called <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/energy-transition/hydrogen/zeroe-our-hydrogen-powered-aircraft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ZEROe</a>, as well as Toshiba, Raytheon, and U.K. startup <a href="https://www.hyflux.aero/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HyFlux</a>. However, Hinetics is taking an unusual approach.</p><p>Common approaches to building a superconducting machine use the superconducting material for either the rotor or stator coils, or both. Typically, the coils are cooled with a liquid or gas kept at a sufficiently low temperature by an external cryocooling system. The fluid cools the superconducting coils by convection, by physically flowing through heat exchangers in contact with the coils and carrying away heat as it does so. The system has been used successfully in some experimental motors and generators, but it suffers from several fundamental problems. A big one is the need to circulate the cooling fluid through the rotor coils, which are embedded in a rotor assembly that is spinning at perhaps thousands of revolutions per minute. Another problem is that this approach requires a complicated cryocooling system that includes pumps, seals, gaskets, pipes, insulation, a rotary coupling that transfers the cryogen into and out of the rotor, and other components that can fail and that add considerable weight.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="An experimental electric motor is shown in a cutaway view." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0c402a9027bc072395e4ec51432ee22c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="3601d" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-experimental-electric-motor-is-shown-in-a-cutaway-view.jpg?id=61106310&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The rotor coils in an experimental Hinetics electric motor are made of a high-temperature superconductor. They are cooled by a cryocooler that runs axially down the center of the motor. The rotor assembly and the cryocooler are enclosed within a vacuum vessel.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Hinetics</small></p><h2>Hinetics’s Revolutionary Idea: Spin the Cryocooler</h2><p>Hinetics’s system, on the other hand, uses a self-contained cryocooler that is small enough to be attached to the rotor, and which spins along with it, eliminating the need to pass fluids into and out of a spinning vessel. With this arrangement, “you don’t have to immerse the superconductor into the fluid,” notes Laurent Pilon, an associate director for technology at ARPA-E. Instead, “there’s a cryocooler, and a cold connection, and you pull out the heat from the superconducting magnetic coils to the cryocooler, performing a refrigeration cycle. The beauty here is that it simplifies everything because now you just have the cryocooler that spins with the shaft.”</p><p>In this configuration, the rotor assembly, including the coils, is cooled by conduction rather than convection. The rotor is installed within a vacuum chamber. Heat from the superconducting magnet assembly is transferred through a “thermal bus,” which is basically just a disk-shaped copper structure that conducts the heat to the cryocooler, which is attached to the other side of the copper disk.</p><p>One of the challenges, Haran says, was finding a cryocooler small and light enough to spin at high rates and keep functioning while doing so. For its proof-of-concept unit, the Hinetics team used an off-the-shelf <a href="https://www.sunpowerinc.com/our-technologies/stirlingcycle" target="_blank">Stirling-cycle</a> cooler from <a href="https://www.sunpowerinc.com/" target="_blank">Sunpower</a>. It can remove only 10 watts of heat from the rotor assembly but, in this configuration, that’s all that’s needed to keep the rotor coils superconducting, Haran says.</p><p>One potential drawback of the system is that, because of this relatively low heat-removal capacity, the cryocooler takes a few hours to cool the superconducting magnet sufficiently to start operating. Future versions will reduce the period needed, according to Haran. And on the bright side, the low heat-removal rate means high efficiency, because the cooler has just enough power to maintain the low temperatures needed during operation, and not much excess capacity.</p><p>To provide electric power to the spinning cryostat and rotor magnets the prototype used a slip ring. But future versions of the motor will use a wireless system, possibly based on inductive coupling, Haran says.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="An experimental electric motor, painted black, is shown on a test bench with a three-bladed propeller attached to its shaft." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="27a58a415f9466df16ad222ba080f68b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="0744a" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-experimental-electric-motor-painted-black-is-shown-on-a-test-bench-with-a-three-bladed-propeller-attached-to-its-shaft.jpg?id=61104840&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Tests of Hinetics’s superconducting motor this past April validated the basic design and cleared the way for construction of  more powerful units.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Hinetics</small></p><h2>Applications on Ships Are Also Possible</h2><p>He opted not to make the stators superconducting, because in a typical configuration the stator is energized by an alternating-current (AC) waveform. Superconductors are only completely lossless for direct current. So the application of AC to superconducting coils in the stator would result in power losses that would require another cooling system to remove heat from the stator.</p><p>Haran figures it’s not necessary. With superconductors just in the rotor coils, the motor will achieve efficiencies in the range of 98 to 99.5 percent, which is about four or five percentage points higher than what is realistically possible with a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Haran also insists that the superconducting design would attain this high efficiency without any reduction in power density, a combination that’s hard to achieve in a conventional motor.</p><p>Four or five percentage points might not seem like a lot, but it would matter in typical aviation applications, Pilon says, especially when coupled with higher power density. On its website, Hinetics claims that its motor has a continuous specific power of <a href="https://hinetics.com/" target="_blank">10 kilowatts per kilogram</a>, which would put the machine among the most power-dense units available, on a continuous-power basis. According to Haran, the next generation of the superconducting motor will achieve 40 kW/kg, which would be far higher than anything commercially available.</p><p>Although aviation is the initial target, Haran sees potential applications in ship propulsion, where the motor’s high volumetric power density would be a draw. “What’s really exciting is that we are seeing a transformational new technology become practical,” he says. “Once you get to megawatts and low speed, anywhere you need high torque, this could be very interesting.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-aircraft-motor-hinetics</guid><category>Cryocooling system</category><category>Electric aircraft</category><category>Electric aircraft motors</category><category>Hightemperature superconductors</category><category>Ship propulsion</category><category>Superconducting motor</category><dc:creator>Glenn Zorpette</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-group-of-11-men-watch-a-large-electric-motor-spin-a-propeller.jpg?id=61090759&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Estonia Debuts AI Chatbots for High School Classrooms</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/estonia-ai-leap</link><description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-ai-visualization-with-labeled-nodes-and-directional-arrows.png?id=61103737&width=1500&height=2000&coordinates=419%2C0%2C419%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Estonia has a reputation as one of the most digitally advanced nations in the world, thanks to its efficient <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/estonia-manages-legacy-it" target="_self">digital platforms for government services</a> and its startup-friendly culture. Its citizens’ digital prowess is largely due to the government’s decades-long campaign to bring technology into schools. Now, the government is launching <a href="https://www.aileap.ee/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AI Leap 2025</a>, which will bring AI tools to an initial cohort of 20,000 high school students in September. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siimsikkut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siim Sikkut</a>, a former member of the Estonian government and part of the launch team, says the AI Leap program goes beyond just providing access to new technology. Its goal is to give students the skills they need to use it both ethically and effectively.</p><h3>Slim Sikkut</h3><br/><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siimsikkut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siim Sikkut</a> served as the Estonian government’s chief information officer from 2017 to 2022, a role in which he created policies regarding digital government operations, cybersecurity, and connectivity. He is currently a managing partner at <a href="https://www.digitalnation.eu/" target="_blank">Digital Nation</a>, an Estonian consulting firm that works with governments around the world.<br/></p><p><strong>What was the Tiger Leap program, and how is it the model for what you’re doing now?</strong></p><p><strong>Siim Sikkut:</strong> Tiger Leap was a program in the ’90s to bring computers and Internet and basic digital skills to all the schools in Estonia. I myself got exposed to all things Internet, because at that time, we didn’t have a chance to use them at home. These guys and girls became the founders of industry and of digital government, so it allowed us to make a leap in building a digital society in Estonia. </p><p><strong>How does the AI Leap program follow that model?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>Our thinking is now we have to do the same sort of leap and expose our younger generations to this next wave [of technology]. There are differences between the programs. Then it was, We’ll give you the access and the tools to do with what you like. Now, with AI tools, we feel it has to be a bit more curated. You need to learn to use them as opposed to just getting an easier way out of your homework. So it’s more of a skilling effort than just an access effort.</p><p><strong>What will this look like in practice? What tools will the students have access to?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>We are still negotiating with the partners and vendors, so I won’t be naming companies. But fundamentally, we’re talking about a conversational AI assistant that is trained in the context of Estonian language and Estonian curriculum. It will be built for educational use, so it won’t be, for example, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt" target="_self">ChatGPT</a> that you and I would use in our daily life. It will support the learning more. For example, you don’t just submit your homework and get the answers back. In that scenario, the tool starts to tutor you more than give you an answer. We’re re-creating conversational AI as a learning assistant, and ideally we’ll have a lot of smaller subject-based apps added to that. We will have in place at least one tool, a conversation tool, and then we’ll build on that in the next few years.</p><p><strong>Will the teachers be able to see what the students are doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>We might have to launch it first just with basics. But the idea is that we’ll have two apps, a teacher’s assistant and a student’s one, so teachers get feedback or recommendations on how to guide the particular student better. The idea is to make learning more personalized for better learning outcomes.</p><p><strong>When we hear about AI in education, there’s usually a doom and gloom attitude like, “This is going to ruin the minds of the next generation. There’s no way they’re going to learn anything. They’re just going to have these shortcuts.”</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>These same concerns led us to do more on this front. What’s really driving us are two very pragmatic considerations. A lot of kids use [AI tools] anyway to substitute thinking more than to complement it. We have numbers that 70 percent of kids in high school use them anyway. So the harmful use is already there, and we want to counter that. Secondly, there’s a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-divide" target="_self">divide</a> in use, maybe for reasons of socioeconomic background. But Estonia’s whole education system is built on uniform opportunity. So this is also an attempt to make sure that we don’t increase the divide for the future.</p><p><strong>And what is the opportunity that you see for the students?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>We’re making a bet that this is a competitiveness factor. If you’re not there, you’re left out. In the labor market, as a country, globally speaking, we’re saying, “Hey, look, you need to know how to get the most out of these tools.”</p><p><strong>The current program will provide tools to 10th and 11th graders, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>Yes, we’re focusing on high school and vocational education now. But there’s still a debate going on: Should we go younger than that? The jury is still out on whether that would make sense. You need to have some independent thinking and study discipline and just be a self-driven learner. That doesn’t start early.</p><p><strong>Are there concerns about </strong><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination" target="_self"><strong>hallucinations</strong></a><strong> and how to teach kids how to check for accuracy?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>That goes right into the technical skill set of using these things. Unfortunately, hallucinations are a fact of life, and they will be for the time [being]. These AI skills will be taught by applying them in the rest of the curriculum. So in history class, as you use this AI study assistant, that’s where you learn about hallucinations and how to watch out for them.</p><p><strong>Have you talked about this program with teachers? Are they receptive or nervous?</strong></p><p><strong>Sikkut: </strong>It’s all of the above. As you can imagine, you have early adopters who are enthusiastic. Today, they’re already using these tools to plan for their class, or they run essays through an AI tool. On the other end, you have folks who have basic digital literacy, but they don’t want anything more than that. We’ll have a communication effort to make sure that the teachers are okay and calm about it. The main message we’re trying to tell teachers is that they won’t get the full suite of tools yet. They will all be part of an experimentation program.</p><p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 2025 issue as “5 Questions for Siim Sikkut.”</em><br/></p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:33:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/estonia-ai-leap</guid><category>5 questions</category><category>Chatbots</category><category>Type:departments</category><category>Estonia</category><category>Artificial intelligence</category><category>Education</category><dc:creator>Eliza Strickland</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-ai-visualization-with-labeled-nodes-and-directional-arrows.png?id=61103737&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>IEEE Presidents’ Scholarship Changes Students’ Lives</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-scholarship</link><description><![CDATA[

As that number continues to increase, so do the risks of that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/averting-space-doom-solving-the-orbital-junk-problem" target="_blank">critical area surrounding Earth becoming impassable</a>, trapping us on the planet for the foreseeable future. Ideas from different labs have presented potential solutions to this problem, but one of the most promising, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether" target="_blank">electrodynamic tethers</a> (EDTs), have only now begun to be tested in space. A new <a data-linked-post="2659652601" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cubesat" target="_blank">CubeSat</a> called the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391689140_SPARCS_Design_and_Development_of_CubeSats_for_Advanced_Research_and_Cooperative_Studies" target="_blank">Spacecraft for Advanced Research and Cooperative Studies</a> (SPARCS) mission from researchers at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> in Tehran hopes to contribute to that effort by testing an EDT and intersatellite communication system as well as collecting real-time data on the radiation environment of its orbital path.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/"></a><a class="shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons" title="Select for lightbox">aspect_ratio</a><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/" target="_blank"><img alt='Universe Today logo; text reads "This post originally appeared on Universe Today."' class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="087bc0ad57330681cee5d3354f3d2ac7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b9dd2" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&width=980"/></a></p><p>SPARCS actually consists of two separate CubeSats. SPARCS-A is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat#Design" target="_blank">1U CubeSat</a> primarily designed as a communications platform, with the mission design requiring it to talk to SPARCS-B, which is a 2U CubeSat that, in addition to the communication system, contains a EDT. That EDT, which can measure up to 12 meters in length, is deployed via a servomotor, with a camera watching to ensure proper deployment.</p><p>EDTs are essentially giant poles with electric current running through them. They use this current, and the tiny magnetic field it produces, to push off of the Earth’s natural magnetic sphere using a property called the Lorentz force. This allows the satellite to adjust its orbit without the use of fuel, simply by orienting its EDT in a specific direction (which the EDT itself can assist with) and then using the Lorentz force to either push it up into a higher orbit, or—more significant for the purposes for technology demonstration—to slow the CubeSat down to a point where it can make a controlled entry into the atmosphere.</p><h2>Why Are EDTs Important for Satellites?</h2><p><span>That controlled-entry feature is why EDTs have garnered so much attention. Previous missions, such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576520301429" target="_blank">KITE</a> from JAXA and <a href="https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/research_teams/mitee-21/" target="_blank">MiTEE</a> from the University of Michigan, have already attempted to use EDTs to change their orbits. Unfortunately neither of those missions successfully utilized their EDT, though a follow-up mission called MiTEE-2 is in the works with an even larger EDT than SPARCS.</span></p><p>The final piece of SPARCS’ kit is its dosimeter, which is intended to monitor the radiation environment of its orbit. As anyone familiar with spacecraft design knows, radiation hardening of electronics is absolutely critical to the success of a mission, but it is also expensive and time consuming, so it is best done at a minimal required level. Understanding the radiation environment of this popular orbital path can help future engineers make better, and hopefully less expensive, design decisions tailored to operation in this specific area.</p><p><span>Engineers have already finalized the design for the mission and have run simulations showing its expected operations. They have now moved on to building an engineering model of the two CubeSats, allowing them to validate their design and test the real-world implementation before it is ready for launch. Given the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-real-story-of-stuxnet" target="_blank">current turmoil</a> in that region of the world, there is a chance that conflict could put a halt to development of this system. But, if successfully tested and launched, the very first demonstration of an EDT system could be deployed in the not-too-distant future.</span></p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 16:38:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/electrodynamic-tether-deborbit-satellite</guid><category>Cubesats</category><category>Orbital debris</category><category>Satellites</category><category>Kessler syndrome</category><dc:creator>Andy Tomaswick</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/gloved-hands-assembling-an-electronic-circuit-board-on-a-workbench.jpg?id=61083088&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Transforming Physical Substation Security</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/meerkat-substation-security</link><description><![CDATA[

Many utilities still operate with legacy or manual security protocols that rely on reactive rather than proactive strategies. The slow pace of technology adoption further compounds these issues, increasing the vulnerability of critical assets to inefficiencies, downtime and physical threats.

When pre-existing data of the site is available and of good quality and accuracy, it can be used for this process. However, when there is not sufficient data available, the Meerkat team collects its own high-fidelity data of the study area. This includes the substation facility, property and all surrounding terrain and infrastructure within an established radius of concern.</p><h3>Step Two: Build a Model</h3><p>Next, the high-quality data is transformed into an interactive 3D model in a virtual environment. The model is so accurate that it can facilitate virtual site visits. Users can navigate around the substation environment by clicking and dragging on screen and can visualize the site from any point ranging from a bird’s-eye view to the perspective of a potential bad actor looking into the station.</p><h3>Step Three: Test Mitigations in Real Time</h3><p>This interactive model serves as a virtual sandbox where mitigation strategies can be tested in real time. It can comprehensively and objectively map all line-of-sight vulnerabilities—big and small—that a bad actor might use to attack critical components. Then, existing or proposed mitigation strategies, if available, can be tested and validated within the system. This stage is great for testing what-if scenarios and seeing how multiple mitigations interact if combined before construction even comes into play.</p><h3>Step Four: Find the Best-Cost Solution</h3><p>POWER’s team of industry-leading experts use their knowledge to guide iterative solutions that bring substation owners and operators closer to the best-cost solutions for their substations. Sometimes moving or changing the height of a proposed wall is all it takes to drastically improve protections without drastically changing the price. A built-in cost estimator can also give a rough idea of how material costs change as the design does.</p><h2>The Benefits of Using Meerkat</h2><p>Meerkat is an industry-leading technology that offers unparalleled benefits in conducting thorough vulnerability assessments for critical assets at substations. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms and high-quality data, Meerkat delivers precise evaluations that pinpoint potential weaknesses with exceptional accuracy. This comprehensive approach means that every aspect of a substation’s physical security is meticulously analyzed, leaving no stone unturned.</p><h3>Enhanced Efficiency</h3><p>One of the key advantages of Meerkat is its ability to significantly enhance efficiency in the assessment process. This not only reduces the time and resources required for site assessments but also ensures consistent and reliable results.</p><p>Meerkat also allows an evaluation and design process that can sometimes take months of back-and-forth communication to happen in just a handful of hour-long workshops.</p><h3>Improved Accuracy</h3><p>Accuracy is another hallmark of Meerkat, as it eliminates the guesswork associated with human-based evaluations. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, Meerkat provides actionable insights that empower utilities to make informed decisions regarding security upgrades and mitigations. This precision facilitates proactive risk management strategies, allowing stakeholders to address vulnerabilities before they manifest into tangible threats.</p><p>Ultimately, by improving both efficiency and accuracy in vulnerability assessments, Meerkat enables better decision-making processes that enhance overall risk management. Utilities can confidently implement targeted security measures tailored to each site’s unique needs, ensuring robust protection against emerging threats while optimizing resource allocation. In a landscape where rapid technological advancements challenge conventional practices, Meerkat stands as a vital tool for safeguarding critical infrastructure with foresight and precision.</p><h3>A Case Study: Strategic Security Optimization with Meerkat</h3><br/><p><em>The following case study has been sanitized of identifying information to maintain the security of the facility.</em></p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>A client faced a critical decision regarding the security of their substation, which was surrounded by a chain-link fence spanning 3,523 linear feet. Concerned about potential line-of-sight attacks on their critical assets, they planned to construct a new 15 ft tall concrete masonry unit (CMU) wall around the entire perimeter. Before proceeding with this significant investment, they sought validation from physical security experts at POWER and used the advanced threat assessment capabilities of Meerkat.</p><p><strong>Security Plan Validation</strong></p><p>To assess the effectiveness of the proposed security plan, Meerkat was employed to model the 15 ft wall within a highly accurate digital representation of the facility and its surroundings. The comprehensive data-backed threat assessment revealed lingering vulnerabilities despite the proposed construction. With estimated costs between $12 million and $15 million—and additional expenses for ballistic rated gates—the financial implications were substantial.</p><p><strong>Working Backward</strong></p><p>Recognizing that the original plan might not sufficiently mitigate risks, the client collaborated with Meerkat experts and key personnel across disciplines—including electrical engineers, civil engineers and transmission planners—to explore alternative strategies. Through a series of concise workshops over several days, they reimagined security designs by focusing on protecting critical assets identified as essential to system stability.</p><p>Meerkat enabled real-time modeling and testing of diverse mitigation strategies. Its interactive features allowed stakeholders to dynamically adjust protective measures—such as repositioning or resizing ballistic barriers—with immediate insights into effectiveness against vulnerabilities. This iterative process prioritized achieving the optimal balance between cost efficiency and robust protection.</p><p><strong>The Results</strong></p><p>Through strategic analysis using Meerkat, it became clear that constructing two separate 166 ft long, 25 ft tall walls at targeted locations around critical assets offered superior protection compared to encircling the entire perimeter with a single structure. This solution significantly enhanced security while reducing the estimated implementation costs to approximately $3.4 million—about a quarter of the cost of the initial projections.</p><p>Ultimately, the revised approach not only lowered risk profiles but also prevented unnecessary expenditure on inadequate defenses. By leveraging the advanced technology provided by Meerkat, the client successfully optimized resource allocation, comprehensively safeguarding their vital infrastructure.</p><h2><span>Get Started</span></h2><p>Any entity interested in learning more about Meerkat and its applications can request a free demonstration from our team of experts at <a href="https://meerkat.powereng.com/home?utm_source=industrypublication&utm_medium=native&utm_campaign=PE2025_IP_MBU-BM-EDS-FP-MeerkatIEEESNC_TRF&utm_content=MBU-BM-EDS-FP-MeerkatIEEESNC_Multiple_MIEEEIAL" target="_blank">meerkat.powereng.com</a>.</p><div class="ieee-image-small"><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Meerkat Power Engineers logo in black and red font with a shield emblem above." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="89a8d2cf23d243a4b12f1249442c9201" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ed2d2" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/meerkat-power-engineers-logo-in-black-and-red-font-with-a-shield-emblem-above.png?id=61013898&width=980"/></p></div>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 12:22:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/meerkat-substation-security</guid><category>Digital transformation</category><category>Substation security</category><category>Vulnerability assessments</category><category>Security analysis</category><category>Security</category><dc:creator>POWER Engineers, Member of WSP</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aerial-of-a-power-station-with-highlighted-threat-zones-and-bad-actor-location.png?id=61081553&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>How the Rubin Observatory Will Reinvent Astronomy</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/vera-rubin-observatory-first-images</link><description><![CDATA[

I focus my camera across the summit to the westernmost peak of the mountain. Silhouetted within a dying blaze of red and orange light looms the sphinxlike shape of the <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a>.</p><p>“Not bad,” says <a href="https://www.lsst.org/about/team/wil-omullane" target="_blank">William O’Mullane</a>, the observatory’s deputy project manager, amateur photographer, and master of understatement. We watch as the sky fades through reds and purples to a deep, velvety black. It’s my first night in Chile. For O’Mullane, and hundreds of other astronomers and engineers, it’s the culmination of years of work, as the Rubin Observatory is finally ready to go “on sky.”</p><p>Rubin is unlike any telescope ever built. Its exceptionally wide field of view, extreme speed, and massive digital camera will soon begin the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (<a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/explore/how-rubin-works/lsst" target="_blank">LSST</a>) across the entire southern sky. The result will be a high-resolution movie of how our solar system, galaxy, and universe change over time, along with hundreds of petabytes of data representing billions of celestial objects that have never been seen before.</p><p>Stars begin to appear overhead, and O’Mullane and I pack up our cameras.

Spanning about 1.5 kilometers at 2,647 meters of elevation, its three peaks are home to the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (<a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/soar-telescope/" target="_blank">SOAR</a>), the <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/gemini-observatory/gemini-south/" target="_blank">Gemini South Telescope</a>, and for the last decade, the Vera Rubin Observatory construction site. An hour’s flight north of the Chilean capital of Santiago, these foothills of the Andes offer uniquely stable weather. The Humboldt Current flows just offshore, cooling the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean enough to minimize atmospheric moisture, resulting in some of the best “seeing,” as astronomers put it, in the world.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Map showing Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, near La Serena and Santiago." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="81465e6874b0a2d4ca6b19dd26e60a43" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="d419b" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/map-showing-vera-c-rubin-observatory-in-chile-near-la-serena-and-santiago.png?id=61079069&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>It’s a complicated but exciting time to be visiting. It’s mid-April of 2025, and I’ve arrived just a few days before “first photon,” when light from the night sky will travel through the completed telescope and into its camera for the first time. In the control room on the second floor, engineers and astronomers make plans for the evening’s tests. O’Mullane and I head up into a high bay that contains the silvering chamber for the telescope’s mirrors and a clean room for the camera and its filters. Increasingly exhausting flights of stairs lead to the massive pier on which the telescope sits, and then up again into the dome.</p><p>I suddenly feel very, very small. The Simonyi Survey Telescope towers above us—350 tonnes of steel and glass, nestled within the 30-meter-wide, 650-tonne dome. One final flight of stairs and we’re standing on the telescope platform. In its parked position, the telescope is pointed at horizon, meaning that it’s looking straight at me as I step in front of it and peer inside.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Modern observatory under a starry night sky on a rocky hilltop." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="e5d8ac1a3234928fae5a0e9d20b48c9b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b09ed" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/modern-observatory-under-a-starry-night-sky-on-a-rocky-hilltop.jpg?id=61079018&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The telescope’s enormous 8.4-meter primary mirror is so flawlessly reflective that it’s essentially invisible. Made of a single piece of low-expansion borosilicate glass covered in a 120-nanometer-thick layer of pure silver, the huge mirror acts as two different mirrors, with a more pronounced curvature toward the center. Standing this close means that different reflections of the mirrors, the camera, and the structure of the telescope all clash with one another in a way that shifts every time I move. I feel like if I can somehow look at it in just the right way, it will all make sense. But I can’t, and it doesn’t.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Diagram of a telescope with labeled mirrors, lenses, filters, and camera components." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="41ac3b3bcd8dff4b1ba021f7efe8cec3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a0745" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-telescope-with-labeled-mirrors-lenses-filters-and-camera-components.png?id=61079019&width=980"/><p>I’m rescued from madness by O’Mullane snapping photos next to me. “Why?” I ask him. “You see this every day, right?”</p><p>“This has never been seen before,” he tells me. “It’s the first time, ever, that the lens cover has been off the camera since it’s been on the telescope.” Indeed, deep inside the nested reflections I can see a blue circle, the r-band filter within the camera itself. As of today, it’s ready to capture the universe.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Two images show the inner parts of a telescope, with large mirrors and a camera housed inside a metal frame." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="f368f2c2e79daf918d78617bac9c9c4f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="e07ec" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-images-show-the-inner-parts-of-a-telescope-with-large-mirrors-and-a-camera-housed-inside-a-metal-frame.png?id=61079027&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Close-up of a large, complex astronomical telescope structure in an observatory." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ebb33fd87f829faf8f8aba8f2fd2213c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="80ae6" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-large-complex-astronomical-telescope-structure-in-an-observatory.jpg?id=61079033&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Large telescope inside observatory dome against a bright starry night sky." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="986dd7896096599c527677a99bbfda40" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4be71" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-telescope-inside-observatory-dome-against-a-bright-starry-night-sky.jpg?id=61078913&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h2>Rubin’s Wide View Unveils the Universe</h2><p>Back down in the control room, I find director of construction Željko Ivezić. He’s just come up from the summit hotel, which has several dozen rooms for lucky visitors like myself, plus a few even luckier staff members. The rest of the staff commutes daily from the coastal town of La Serena, a 4-hour round trip.</p><p>To me, the summit hotel seems luxurious for lodgings at the top of a remote mountain. But Ivezić has a slightly different perspective. “The European-funded telescopes,” he grumbles, “have swimming pools at their hotels. And they serve wine with lunch! Up here, there’s no alcohol. It’s an American thing.” He’s referring to the fact that <a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2023-03/37_fy2024.pdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rubin is primarily funded</a> by the U.S. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> and the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science" target="_blank">Office of Science</a>, which have strict safety requirements.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Silhouetted telescope under a starry sky and vibrant, colorful sunset." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="b492254ba5a5b929bfc315a49a32eb62" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="69e31" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/silhouetted-telescope-under-a-starry-sky-and-vibrant-colorful-sunset.jpg?id=61079034&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Originally, Rubin was intended to be a dark-matter survey telescope, to search for the 85 percent of the mass of the universe that we know exists but can’t identify. In the 1970s, astronomer <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5338491/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vera C. Rubin</a> pioneered a spectroscopic method to measure the speed at which stars orbit around the centers of their galaxies, revealing motion that could be explained only by the presence of a halo of invisible mass at least five times the apparent mass of the galaxies themselves. Dark matter can warp the space around it enough that galaxies act as lenses, bending light from even more distant galaxies as it passes around them. It’s this gravitational lensing that the Rubin observatory was designed to detect on a massive scale. But once astronomers considered what else might be possible with a survey telescope that combined enormous light-collecting ability with a wide field of view, Rubin’s science mission rapidly expanded beyond dark matter.</p><p>Trading the ability to focus on individual objects for a wide field of view that can see tens of thousands of objects at once provides a critical perspective for understanding our universe, says Ivezić. Rubin will complement other observatories like the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hubble-space-telescope-re-invention" target="_self">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/james-webb-telescope/" target="_self">James Webb Space Telescope</a>. <a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3</a> and <a href="https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera#gsc.tab=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Webb’s Near Infrared Camera</a> have fields of view of less than 0.05 square degrees each, equivalent to just a few percent of the size of a full moon. The upcoming <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/rogue-planet" target="_self">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a> will see a bit more, with a field of view of about one full moon. Rubin, by contrast, can image 9.6 square degrees at a time—about 45 full moons’ worth of sky.</p><p class="ieee-inbody-related">RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/rogue-planet" target="_self">A Trillion Rogue Planets and Not One Sun to Shine on Them</a></p><p>That ultrawide view offers essential context, Ivezić explains. “My wife is American, but I’m from Croatia,” he says. “Whenever we go to Croatia, she meets many people. I asked her, ‘Did you learn more about Croatia by meeting many people very superficially, or because you know me very well?’ And she said, ‘You need both. I learn a lot from you, but you could be a weirdo, so I need a control sample.’ ” Rubin is providing that control sample, so that astronomers know just how weird whatever they’re looking at in more detail might be.</p><h3>Explore Rubin Observatory’s First Images With Skyviewer</h3><br/><iframe allowed="fullscreen; clipboard-write; clipboard-read; web-share" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-scripts allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-forms" src="https://skyviewer.app/embed" style="border: none; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; min-height: 500px; max-height: 100%"></iframe><p>Rubin Observatory’s <a href="https://skyviewer.app/" target="_blank">Skyviewer</a> app lets you explore its stunning first images by interactively navigating a vast, detailed view of the cosmos — you can zoom in and out and move around to examine the rich tapestry of stars and galaxies in extraordinary detail. The area observed includes the southern region of the Virgo Cluster — approximately 55 million light-years from Earth — as well as closer stars in the Milky Way and much more distant galaxy groups. This image, built from over 3 trillion pixels of data collected in just seven nights, contains millions of galaxies. Eventually, the full <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/explore/how-rubin-works/lsst" target="_blank">Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</a> will catalog about 20 billion galaxies of all types, and from all times in the history of the Universe.<br/></p><h3></h3><br><p>Every night, the telescope will take a thousand images, one every 34 seconds. After three or four nights, it’ll have the entire southern sky covered, and then it’ll start all over again. After a decade, Rubin will have taken more than 2 million images, generated 500 petabytes of data, and visited every object it can see at least 825 times. In addition to identifying an estimated 6 million bodies in our solar system, 17 billion stars in our galaxy, and 20 billion galaxies in our universe, Rubin’s rapid cadence means that it will be able to delve into the time domain, tracking how the entire southern sky changes on an almost daily basis.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Cutting-Edge Technology Behind Rubin’s Speed</h2><p>Achieving these science goals meant pushing the technical envelope on nearly every aspect of the observatory. But what drove most of the design decisions is the speed at which Rubin needs to move (3.5 degrees per second)—the phrase most commonly used by the Rubin staff is “crazy fast.”</p><h3></h3><br/><span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="4aa52bc458fa1bc86c7aa06457d17e9d" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8kF9PrMXqBU?rel=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"></iframe></span><h3></h3><br/><p>Crazy fast movement is why the telescope looks the way it does. The squat arrangement of the mirrors and camera centralizes as much mass as possible. Rubin’s oversize supporting pier is mostly steel rather than mostly concrete so that the movement of the telescope doesn’t twist the entire pier. And then there’s the megawatt of power required to drive this whole thing, which comes from huge banks of capacitors slung under the telescope to prevent a brownout on the summit every 30 seconds all night long.</p><p>Rubin is also unique in that it utilizes the largest digital camera ever built. The size of a small car and weighing 2,800 kilograms, the LSST camera captures 3.2-gigapixel images through six swappable color filters ranging from near infrared to near ultraviolet. The camera’s focal plane consists of 189 4K-by-4K charge-coupled devices grouped into 21 “rafts.” Every CCD is backed by 16 amplifiers that each read 1 million pixels, bringing the readout time for the entire sensor down to 2 seconds flat.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Technician examines a large telescope camera in a clean room environment." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="73a69383c750509ec15ecca488fb763d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="16585" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technician-examines-a-large-telescope-camera-in-a-clean-room-environment.jpg?id=61079036&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h2>Astronomy in the Time Domain</h2><p>As humans with tiny eyeballs and short lifespans who are more or less stranded on Earth, we have only the faintest idea of how dynamic our universe is. To us, the night sky seems mostly static and also mostly empty. This is emphatically not the case.</p><p>In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope pointed at a small and deliberately unremarkable part of the sky for a cumulative six days. The resulting image, called the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/universe-uncovered/hubble-deep-fields/" target="_blank">Hubble Deep Field</a>, revealed about 3,000 distant galaxies in an area that represented just one twenty-four-millionth of the sky. To observatories like Hubble, and now Rubin, the sky is crammed full of so many objects that it becomes a problem. As O’Mullane puts it, “There’s almost nothing not touching something.”</p><p>One of Rubin’s biggest challenges will be deblending—­identifying and then separating things like stars and galaxies that appear to overlap. This has to be done carefully by using images taken through different filters to estimate how much of the brightness of a given pixel comes from each object.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Exploded diagram of a large telescope camera, with labeled parts including lens, shutter, filters, and a 3.2-gigapixel CCD." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="9b28eeff16dde98dae9b8fa724a5930b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="402f3" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/exploded-diagram-of-a-large-telescope-camera-with-labeled-parts-including-lens-shutter-filters-and-a-3-2-gigapixel-ccd.png?id=61079041&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>At first, Rubin won’t have this problem. At each location, the camera will capture one 30-second exposure before moving on. As Rubin returns to each location every three or four days, subsequent exposures will be combined in a process called coadding. In a coadded image, each pixel represents all of the data collected from that location in every previous image, which results in a much longer effective exposure time. The camera may record only a few photons from a distant galaxy in each individual image, but a few photons per image added together over 825 images yields much richer data. By the end of Rubin’s 10-year survey, the coadding process will generate images with as much detail as a typical Hubble image, but over the entire southern sky. A few lucky areas called “<a href="https://survey-strategy.lsst.io/baseline/ddf.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deep drilling fields</a>” will receive even more attention, with each one getting a staggering 23,000 images or more.</p><p>Rubin will add every object that it detects to its catalog, and over time, the catalog will provide a baseline of the night sky, which the observatory can then use to identify changes. Some of these changes will be movement—Rubin may see an object in one place, and then spot it in a different place some time later, which is how objects like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/planetary-defense-killer-asteroids" target="_self">near-Earth asteroids</a> will be detected. But the vast majority of the changes will be in brightness rather than movement.</p><p class="ieee-inbody-related">RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/planetary-defense-killer-asteroids" target="_self">Three Steps to Stopping Killer Asteroids</a></p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A circle with grid lines overlaying a night sky background with stars and a full moon." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="3da7febf385d5d7e3565ead376c2b3fb" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="94e9a" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-circle-with-grid-lines-overlaying-a-night-sky-background-with-stars-and-a-full-moon.png?id=61079047&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Every image that Rubin collects will be compared with a baseline image, and any change will automatically generate a software alert within 60 seconds of when the image was taken. Rubin’s wide field of view means that there will be a lot of these alerts—on the order of 10,000 per image, or 10 million alerts per night. Other automated systems will manage the alerts. Called alert brokers, they ingest the alert streams and filter them for the scientific community. If you’re an astronomer interested in Type Ia supernovae, for example, you can subscribe to an alert broker and set up a filter so that you’ll get notified when Rubin spots one.</p><p>Many of these alerts will be triggered by variable stars, which cyclically change in brightness. Rubin is also expected to identify somewhere <a href="https://www.lsst.org/science/transient-optical-sky/supernovae" target="_blank">between 3 million and 4 million supernovae</a>—that works out to over a thousand new supernovae for every night of observing. And the rest of the alerts? Nobody knows for sure, and that’s why the alerts have to go out so quickly, so that other telescopes can react to make deeper observations of what Rubin finds.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Managing Rubin’s Vast Data Output</h2><p>After the data leaves Rubin’s camera, most of the processing will take place at the <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> in Menlo Park, Calif., over 9,000 kilometers from Cerro Pachón. It takes less than 10 seconds for an image to travel from the focal plane of the camera to SLAC, thanks to a 600-gigabit fiber connection from the summit to La Serena, and from there, a dedicated 100-gigabit line and a backup 40-gigabit line that connect to the Department of Energy’s science network in the United States. The 20 terabytes of data that Rubin will produce nightly makes this bandwidth necessary. “There’s a new image every 34 seconds,” O’Mullane tells me. “If I can’t deal with it fast enough, I start to get behind. So everything has to happen on the cadence of half a minute if I want to keep up with the data flow.”</p><p>At SLAC, each image will be calibrated and cleaned up, including the removal of satellite trails. Rubin will see a lot of satellites, but since the satellites are unlikely to appear in the same place in every image, the impact on the data is expected to be minimal when the images are coadded. The processed image is compared with a baseline image and any alerts are sent out, by which time processing of the next image has already begun.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Numerous thick cables hang in an industrial setting, surrounded by blue metal scaffolding." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="269376d383325b40dbf8a0d5cb7bbf6a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="2c0ac" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/numerous-thick-cables-hang-in-an-industrial-setting-surrounded-by-blue-metal-scaffolding.jpg?id=61079049&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>As Rubin’s catalog of objects grows, astronomers <a href="https://dmtn-243.lsst.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will be able to query it</a> in all kinds of useful ways. Want every image of a particular patch of sky? No problem. All the galaxies of a certain shape? A little trickier, but sure. Looking for 10,000 objects that are similar in some dimension to 10,000 other objects? That might take a while, but it’s still possible. Astronomers can even run their own code on the raw data.</p><p>“Pretty much everyone in the astronomy community wants something from Rubin,” O’Mullane explains, “and so they want to make sure that we’re treating the data the right way. All of our code is public. It’s on <a href="https://github.com/lsst" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can see what we’re doing, and if you’ve got a better solution, we’ll take it.”</p><p>One better solution may involve AI. “I think as a community we’re struggling with how we do this,” says O’Mullane. “But it’s probably something we ought to do—curating the data in such a way that it’s consumable by machine learning, providing foundation models, that sort of thing.”</p><p>The data management system is arguably as much of a critical component of the Rubin observatory as the telescope itself. While most telescopes make targeted observations that get distributed to only a few astronomers at a time, Rubin will make its data available to everyone within just a few days, which is a completely different way of doing astronomy. “We’ve essentially promised that we will take every image of everything that everyone has ever wanted to see,” explains <a href="https://www.lsst.org/content/kevin-reil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kevin Reil</a>, Rubin observatory scientist. “If there’s data to be collected, we will try to collect it. And if you’re an astronomer somewhere, and you want an image of something, within three or four days we’ll give you one. It’s a colossal challenge to deliver something on this scale.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Animated image on the left shows an automated mechanism that switches color filters; an image on the right shows how each filter affects the exposures of stars and galaxies." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ac1caf92f248603bd9f1bdf40716d16c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="21741" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/animated-image-on-the-left-shows-an-automated-mechanism-that-switches-color-filters-an-image-on-the-right-shows-how-each-filter.gif?id=61079050&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The more time I spend on the summit, the more I start to think that the science that we know Rubin will accomplish may be the least interesting part of its mission. And despite their best efforts, I get the sense that everyone I talk to is wildly understating the impact it will have on astronomy. The sheer volume of objects, the time domain, the 10 years of coadded data—what new science will all of that reveal? Astronomers have no idea, because we’ve never looked at the universe in this way before. To me, that’s the most fascinating part of what’s about to happen.</p><p>Reil agrees. “You’ve been here,” he says. “You’ve seen what we’re doing. It’s a paradigm shift, a whole new way of doing things. It’s still a telescope and a camera, but we’re changing the world of astronomy. I don’t know how to capture—I mean, it’s the people, the intensity, the awesomeness of it. I want the world to understand the beauty of it all.”</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The Intersection of Science and Engineering</h2><p>Because nobody has built an observatory like Rubin before, there are a lot of things that aren’t working exactly as they should, and a few things that aren’t working at all. The most obvious of these is the dome. The capacitors that drive it blew a fuse the day before I arrived, and the electricians are off the summit for the weekend. The dome shutter can’t open either. Everyone I talk to takes this sort of thing in stride—they have to, because they’ve been troubleshooting issues like these for years.</p><p>I sit down with <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/people/yousuke-utsumi" target="_blank">Yousuke Utsumi</a>, a camera operations scientist who exudes the mixture of excitement and exhaustion that I’m getting used to seeing in the younger staff. “Today is amazingly quiet,” he tells me. “I’m happy about that. But I’m also really tired. I just want to sleep.”</p><p>Just yesterday, Utsumi says, they managed to finally solve a problem that the camera team had been struggling with for weeks—an intermittent fault in the camera cooling system that only seemed to happen when the telescope was moving. This was potentially a very serious problem, and Utsumi’s phone would alert him every time the fault occurred, over and over again in the middle of the night. The fault was finally traced to a cable within the telescope’s structure that used pins that were slightly too small, leading to a loose connection.</p><h3></h3><br/><span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="6e7db8e07af90b232c49a6b7a5a89175" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRr7wpLXas8?rel=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"></iframe></span><h3></h3><br/><p>Utsumi’s contract started in 2017 and was supposed to last three years, but he’s still here. “I wanted to see first photon,” he says. “I’m an astronomer. I’ve been working on this camera so that it can observe the universe. And I want to see that light, from those photons from distant galaxies.” This is something I’ve also been thinking about—those lonely photons traveling through space for billions of years, and within the coming days, a lucky few of them will land on the sensors Utsumi has been tending, and we’ll get to see them. He nods, smiling. “I don’t want to lose one, you know?”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Illuminated telescope interior with vibrant blue and red hues, showcasing intricate machinery." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="c00643cc41a4fbfecec072e87cfff410" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="9d141" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illuminated-telescope-interior-with-vibrant-blue-and-red-hues-showcasing-intricate-machinery.jpg?id=61079051&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Rubin’s commissioning scientists have a unique role, working at the intersection of science and engineering to turn a bunch of custom parts into a functioning science instrument. Commissioning scientist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-pavlovic-6489831a2/" target="_blank">Marina Pavlovic</a> is a postdoc from Serbia with a background in the formation of supermassive black holes created by merging galaxies. “I came here last year as a volunteer,” she tells me. “My plan was to stay for three months, and 11 months later I’m a commissioning scientist. It’s crazy!”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Technicians in clean suits handling a large metallic component in a laboratory." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="630da2a002eb632655116dbcb4585422" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="8d2f5" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technicians-in-clean-suits-handling-a-large-metallic-component-in-a-laboratory.jpg?id=61079052&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Pavlovic’s job is to help diagnose and troubleshoot whatever isn’t working quite right. And since most things aren’t working quite right, she’s been very busy. “I love when things need to be fixed because I am learning about the system more and more every time there’s a problem—every day is a new experience here.”</p><p>I ask her what she’ll do next, once Rubin is up and running. “If you love commissioning instruments, that is something that you can do for the rest of your life, because there are always going to be new instruments,” she says.</p><p>Before that happens, though, Pavlovic has to survive the next few weeks of going on sky. “It’s going to be so emotional. It’s going to be the beginning of a new era in astronomy, and knowing that <em>you</em> did it, that <em>you</em> made it happen, at least a tiny percent of it, that will be a priceless moment.”</p><p>“I had to learn how to calm down to do this job,” she admits, “because sometimes I get too excited about things and I cannot sleep after that. But it’s okay. I started doing yoga, and it’s working.”</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>From First Photon to First Light</h2><p>My stay on the summit comes to an end on 14 April, just a day before first photon, so as soon as I get home I check in with some of the engineers and astronomers that I met to see how things went. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gmegiashomar/" target="_blank">Guillem Megias Homar</a> manages the adaptive optics system—232 actuators that flex the surfaces of the telescope’s three mirrors a few micrometers at a time to bring the image into perfect focus. Currently working on his Ph.D., he was born in 1997, one year after the Rubin project started.</p><p>First photon, for him, went like this: “I was in the control room, sitting next to the camera team. We have a microphone on the camera, so that we can hear when the shutter is moving. And we hear the first click. And then all of a sudden, the image shows up on the screens in the control room, and it was just an explosion of emotions. All that we have been fighting for is finally a reality. We are on sky!” There were toasts (with sparkling apple juice, of course), and enough speeches that Megias Homar started to get impatient: “I was like, when can we start working? But it was only an hour, and then everything became much more quiet.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Dense galaxy cluster with diverse stars and galaxies scattered across the dark universe background." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0af096dd8e983460a936fb9998613789" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="f82d6" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/dense-galaxy-cluster-with-diverse-stars-and-galaxies-scattered-across-the-dark-universe-background.jpg?id=61079148&width=980"/><p class="hide-on-mobile">Another newly released image showing a small section of the Rubin Observatory’s total view of the Virgo cluster of galaxies.

Operations will soon become routine, the commissioning scientists will move on, and eventually, Rubin will largely run itself, with just a few people at the observatory most nights.</p><p>But for astronomers, the next 10 years will be anything but routine. “It’s going to be wildly different,” says Krabbendam. “Rubin will feed generations of scientists with trillions of data points of billions of objects. Explore the data. Harvest it. Develop your idea, see if it’s there. It’s going to be phenomenal.”<span class="ieee-end-mark"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the July 2025 print issue as “Unveiling a Dynamic Universe.”</em></p><h3></h3><br/><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="listen-conversation-rubin-observatory">Listen to a Conversation About the Rubin Observatory</h3><p>As part of an experiment with AI storytelling tools, author Evan Ackerman—who visited the Vera C.

Rubin Observatory.</p><p>0:06: And and it really is a marvel.</p><p>0:08: This project pushes the limits, you know, not just for the science itself, like mapping the Milky Way or exploring dark energy, which is amazing, obviously.</p><p>0:16: But it’s also pushing the limits in just building the tools, the technical ingenuity, the, the sheer human collaboration needed to make something this complex actually work.</p><p>0:28: That’s what’s really fascinating to me.</p><p>0:29: Exactly.</p><p>0:30: And our mission for this deep dive is to go beyond the headlines, isn’t it?</p><p>0:33: We want to uncover those specific Kind of hidden technical details, the stuff from the audio interviews, the internal docs that really define this observatory.</p><p>0:41: The clever engineering solutions.</p><p>0:43: Yeah, the nuts and bolts, the answers to challenges nobody’s faced before, stuff that anyone who appreciates, you know, complex systems engineering would find really interesting.</p><p>0:53: Definitely.</p><p>0:54: So let’s start right at the heart of it.</p><p>0:57: The Simonyi survey telescope itself.</p><p>1:00: It’s this 350 ton machine inside a 600 ton dome, 30 m wide, huge. [The dome is closer to 650 tons.]</p><p>1:07: But the really astonishing part is its speed, speed and precision.</p><p>1:11: How do you even engineer something that massive to move that quickly while keeping everything stable down to the submicron level? [Micron level is more accurate.]</p><p>1:18: Well, that’s, that’s the core challenge, right?</p><p>1:20: This telescope, it can hit a top speed of 3.5 degrees per second.</p><p>1:24: Wow.</p><p>1:24: Yeah, and it can, you know, move to basically any point in the sky.</p><p>1:28: In under 20 seconds, 20 seconds, which makes it by far the fastest moving large telescope ever built, and the dome has to keep up.</p><p>1:36: So it’s also the fastest moving dome.</p><p>1:38: So the whole building is essentially racing along with the telescope.</p><p>1:41: Exactly.</p><p>1:41: And achieving that meant pretty much every component had to be custom designed like the pier holding the telescope up.</p><p>1:47: It’s mostly steel, not concrete.</p><p>1:49: Oh, interesting.</p><p>1:50: Why steel?</p><p>1:51: Specifically to stop it from twisting or vibrating when the telescope makes those incredibly fast moves.</p><p>1:56: Concrete just wouldn’t handle the torque the same way. [The pier is more steel than concrete, but it's still substantially concrete.]</p><p>1:59: OK, that makes sense.</p><p>1:59: And the power needed to accelerate and decelerate, you know, 300 tons, that must be absolutely massive.</p><p>2:06: Oh.</p><p>2:06: The instantaneous draw would be enormous.</p><p>2:09: How did they manage that without like dimming the lights on the whole.</p><p>2:12: Mountaintop every 30 seconds.</p><p>2:14: Yeah, that was a real concern, constant brownouts.</p><p>2:17: The solution was actually pretty elegant, involving these onboard capacitor banks.</p><p>2:22: Yep, slung right underneath the telescope structure.</p><p>2:24: They can slowly sip power from the grid, store it up over time, and then bam, discharge it really quickly for those big acceleration surges.</p><p>2:32: like a giant camera flash, but for moving a telescope, of yeah.</p><p>2:36: It smooths out the demand, preventing those grid disruptions.</p><p>2:40: Very clever engineering.</p><p>2:41: And beyond the movement, the mirrors themselves, equally critical, equally impressive, I imagine.</p><p>2:47: How did they tackle designing and making optics that large and precise?</p><p>2:51: Right, so the main mirror, the primary mirror, M1M3.</p><p>2:55: It’s a single piece of glass, 8.4 m across, low expansion borosilicate glass.</p><p>3:01: And that 8.4 m size, was that just like the biggest they could manage?</p><p>3:05: Well, it was a really crucial early decision.</p><p>3:07: The science absolutely required something at least 7 or 8 m wide.</p><p>3:13: But going much bigger, say 10 or 12 m, the logistics became almost impossible.</p><p>3:19: The big one was transport.</p><p>3:21: There’s a tunnel on the mountain road up to the summit, and a mirror, much larger than 8.4 m, physically wouldn’t fit through it.</p><p>3:28: No way.</p><p>3:29: So the tunnel actually set an upper limit on the mirror size.</p><p>3:31: Pretty much, yeah.</p><p>3:32: Building new road or some other complex transport method.</p><p>3:36: It would have added enormous cost and complexity.</p><p>3:38: So 8.4 m was that sweet spot between scientific need.</p><p>3:42: And, well, physical reality.</p><p>3:43: Wow, a real world constraint driving fundamental design.</p><p>3:47: And the mirror itself, you said M1 M3, it’s not just one simple mirror surface.</p><p>3:52: Correct.</p><p>3:52: It’s technically two mirror surfaces ground into that single piece of glass.</p><p>3:57: The central part has a more pronounced curvature.</p><p>3:59: It’s M1 and M3 combined.</p><p>4:00: OK, so fabricating that must have been tricky, especially with what, 10 tons of glass just in the center.</p><p>4:07: Oh, absolutely novel and complicated.</p><p>4:09: And these mirrors, they don’t support their own weight rigidly.</p><p>4:12: So just handling them during manufacturing, polishing, even getting them out of the casting mold, was a huge engineering challenge.</p><p>4:18: You can’t just lift it like a dinner plate.</p><p>4:20: Not quite, and then there’s maintaining it, re-silvering.</p><p>4:24: They hope to do it every 5 years.</p><p>4:26: Well, traditionally, big mirrors like this often need it more, like every 1.5 to 2 years, and it’s a risky weeks-long job.</p><p>4:34: You have to unbolt this priceless, unique piece of equipment, move it.</p><p>4:39: It’s nerve-wracking.</p><p>4:40: I bet.</p><p>4:40: And the silver coating itself is tiny, right?</p><p>4:42: Incredibly thin, just a few nanometers of pure silver.</p><p>4:46: It takes about 24 g for the whole giant surface, bonded with the adhesive layers that are measured in Angstroms. [It's closer to 26 grams of silver.]</p><p>4:52: It’s amazing precision.</p><p>4:54: So tying this together, you have this fast moving telescope, massive mirrors.</p><p>4:59: How do they keep everything perfectly focused, especially with multiple optical elements moving relative to each other?</p><p>5:04: that’s where these things called hexapods come in.</p><p>5:08: Really crucial bits of kit.</p><p>5:09: Hexapods, like six feet?</p><p>5:12: Sort of.</p><p>5:13: They’re mechanical systems with 6 adjustable arms or struts.</p><p>5:17: A simpler telescope might just have one maybe on the camera for basic focusing, but Ruben needs more because it’s got the 3 mirrors plus the camera.</p><p>5:25: Exactly.</p><p>5:26: So there’s a hexapod mounted on the secondary mirror, M2.</p><p>5:29: Its job is to keep M2 perfectly positioned relative to M1 and M3, compensating for tiny shifts or flexures.</p><p>5:36: And then there’s another hexapod on the camera itself.</p><p>5:39: That one adjusts the position and tilt of the entire camera’s sensor plane, the focal plane.</p><p>5:43: To get that perfect focus across the whole field of view.</p><p>5:46: And these hexapods move in 6 ways.</p><p>5:48: Yep, 6 degrees of freedom.</p><p>5:50: They can adjust position along the X, Y, and Z axis, and they can adjust rotation or tilt around those 3 axes as well.</p><p>5:57: It allows for incredibly fine adjustments, microp precision stuff.</p><p>6:00: So they’re constantly making these tiny tweaks as the telescope moves.</p><p>6:04: Constantly.</p><p>6:05: The active optics system uses them.</p><p>6:07: It calculates the needed corrections based on reference stars in the images, figures out how the mirror might be slightly bending.</p><p>6:13: And then tells the hexapods how to compensate.</p><p>6:15: It’s controlling like 26 g of silver coating on the mirror surface down to micron precision, using the mirror’s own natural bending modes.</p><p>6:24: It’s pretty wild.</p><p>6:24: Incredible.</p><p>6:25: OK, let’s pivot to the camera itself.</p><p>6:28: The LSST camera.</p><p>6:29: Big digital camera ever built, right?</p><p>6:31: Size of a small car, 2800 kg, captures 3.2 gigapixel images, just staggering numbers.</p><p>6:38: They really are, and the engineering inside is just as staggering.</p><p>6:41: That Socal plane where the light actually hits.</p><p>6:43: It’s made up of 189 individual CCD sensors.</p><p>6:47: Yep, 4K by 4K CCDs grouped into 21 rafts.</p><p>6:50: They give them like tiles, and each CCD has 16 amplifiers reading it out.</p><p>6:54: Why so many amplifiers?</p><p>6:56: Speed.</p><p>6:56: Each amplifier reads out about a million pixels.</p><p>6:59: By dividing the job up like that, they can read out the entire 3.2 gigapixel sensor in just 2 seconds.</p><p>7:04: 2 seconds for that much data.</p><p>7:05: Wow.</p><p>7:06: It’s essential for the survey’s rapid cadence.</p><p>7:09: Getting all those 189 CCDs perfectly flat must have been, I mean, are they delicate?</p><p>7:15: Unbelievably delicate.</p><p>7:16: They’re silicon wafers only 100 microns thick.</p><p>7:18: How thick is that really?</p><p>7:19: about the thickness of a human hair.</p><p>7:22: You could literally break one by breathing on it wrong, apparently, seriously, yeah.</p><p>7:26: And the challenge was aligning all 189 of them across this 650 millimeter wide focal plane, so the entire surface is flat.</p><p>7:34: To within just 24 microns, peak to valley.</p><p>7:37: 24 microns.</p><p>7:39: That sounds impossibly flat.</p><p>7:40: It’s like, imagine the entire United States.</p><p>7:43: Now imagine the difference between the lowest point and the highest point across the whole country was only 100 ft.</p><p>7:49: That’s the kind of relative flatness they achieved on the camera sensor.</p><p>7:52: OK, that puts it in perspective.</p><p>7:53: And why is that level of flatness so critical?</p><p>7:56: Because the telescope focuses light.</p><p>7:58: terribly.</p><p>7:58: It’s an F1.2 system, which means it has a very shallow depth of field.</p><p>8:02: If the sensors aren’t perfectly in that focal plane, even by a few microns, parts of the image go out of focus.</p><p>8:08: Gotcha.</p><p>8:08: And the pixels themselves, the little light buckets on the CCDs, are they special?</p><p>8:14: They’re custom made, definitely.</p><p>8:16: They settled on 10 micron pixels.</p><p>8:18: They figured anything smaller wouldn’t actually give them more useful scientific information.</p><p>8:23: Because you start hitting the limits of what the atmosphere and the telescope optics themselves can resolve.</p><p>8:28: So 10 microns was the optimal size, right?</p><p>8:31: balancing sensor tech with physical limits.</p><p>8:33: Now, keeping something that sensitive cool, that sounds like a nightmare, especially with all those electronics.</p><p>8:39: Oh, it’s a huge thermal engineering challenge.</p><p>8:42: The camera actually has 3 different cooling zones, 3 distinct temperature levels inside.</p><p>8:46: 3.</p><p>8:47: OK.</p><p>8:47: First, the CCDs themselves.</p><p>8:49: They need to be incredibly cold to minimize noise.</p><p>8:51: They operate at -125 °C.</p><p>8:54: -125C, how do they manage that?</p><p>8:57: With a special evaporator plate connected to the CCD rafts by flexible copper braids, which pulls heat away very effectively.</p><p>9:04: Then you’ve got the cameras, electronics, the readout boards and stuff.</p><p>9:07: They run cooler than room temp, but not that cold, around -50 °C.</p><p>9:12: OK.</p><p>9:12: That requires a separate liquid cooling loop delivered through these special vacuum insulated tubes to prevent heat leaks.</p><p>9:18: And the third zone.</p><p>9:19: That’s for the electronics in the utility trunk at the back of the camera.</p><p>9:23: They generate a fair bit of heat, about 3000 watts, like a few hair dryers running constantly.</p><p>9:27: Exactly.</p><p>9:28: So there’s a third liquid cooling system just for them, keeping them just slightly below the ambient room temperature in the dome.</p><p>9:35: And all this cooling, it’s not just to keep the parts from overheating, right?</p><p>9:39: It affects the images, absolutely critical for image quality.</p><p>9:44: If the outer surface of the camera body itself is even slightly warmer or cooler than the air inside the dome, it creates tiny air currents, turbulence right near the light path.</p><p>9:57: And that shows up as little wavy distortions in the images, messing up the precision.</p><p>10:02: So even the outside temperature of the camera matters.</p><p>10:04: Yep, it’s not just a camera.</p><p>10:06: They even have to monitor the heat generated by the motors that move the massive dome, because that heat could potentially cause enough air turbulence inside the dome to affect the image quality too.</p><p>10:16: That’s incredible attention to detail, and the camera interior is a vacuum you mentioned.</p><p>10:21: Yes, a very strong vacuum.</p><p>10:23: They pump it down about once a year, first using turbopumps spinning at like 80,000 RPM to get it down to about 102 tor.</p><p>10:32: Then they use other methods to get it down much further.</p><p>10:34: The 107 tor, that’s an ultra high vacuum.</p><p>10:37: Why the vacuum?</p><p>10:37: Keep frost off the cold part.</p><p>10:39: Exactly.</p><p>10:40: Prevents condensation and frost on those negatives when it 25 degree CCDs and generally ensures everything works optimally.</p><p>10:47: For normal operation, day to day, they use something called an ion pump.</p><p>10:51: How does that work?</p><p>10:52: It basically uses a strong electric field to ionize any stray gas molecules, mostly hydrogen, and trap them, effectively removing them from the vacuum space, very efficient for maintaining that ultra-high vacuum.</p><p>11:04: OK, so we have this incredible camera taking these massive images every few seconds.</p><p>11:08: Once those photons hit the CCDs and become digital signals, What happens next?</p><p>11:12: How does Ruben handle this absolute flood of data?</p><p>11:15: Yeah, this is where Ruben becomes, you know, almost as much a data processing machine as a telescope.</p><p>11:20: It’s designed for the data output.</p><p>11:22: So photons hit the CCDs, get converted to electrical signals.</p><p>11:27: Then, interestingly, they get converted back into light signals, photonic signals back to light.</p><p>11:32: Why?</p><p>11:33: To send them over fiber optics.</p><p>11:34: They’re about 6 kilometers of fiber optic cable running through the observatory building.</p><p>11:39: These signals go to FPGA boards, field programmable gate arrays in the data acquisition system.</p><p>11:46: OK.</p><p>11:46: And those FPGAs are basically assembling the complete image data packages from all the different CCDs and amplifiers.</p><p>11:53: That sounds like a fire hose of data leaving the camera.</p><p>11:56: How does it get off the mountain and where does it need to go?</p><p>11:58: And what about all the like operational data, temperatures, positions?</p><p>12:02: Good question.</p><p>12:03: There are really two main data streams all that telemetry you mentioned, sensor readings, temperatures, actuator positions, command set, everything about the state of the observatory that all gets collected into something called the Engineering facility database or EFD.</p><p>12:16: They use Kafka for transmitting that data.</p><p>12:18: It’s good for high volume streams, and store it in an influx database, which is great for time series data like sensor readings.</p><p>12:26: And astronomers can access that.</p><p>12:28: Well, there’s actually a duplicate copy of the EFD down at SLAC, the research center in California.</p><p>12:34: So scientists and engineers can query that copy without bogging down the live system running on the mountain.</p><p>12:40: Smart.</p><p>12:41: How much data are we talking about there?</p><p>12:43: For the engineering data, it’s about 20 gigabytes per night, and they plan to keep about a year’s worth online.</p><p>12:49: OK.</p><p>12:49: And the image data, the actual science pixels.</p><p>12:52: That takes a different path. [All of the data from Rubin to SLAC travels over the same network.]</p><p>12:53: It travels over dedicated high-speed network links, part of ESET, the research network, all the way from Chile, usually via Boca Raton, Florida, then Atlanta, before finally landing at SLAC.</p><p>13:05: And how fast does that need to be?</p><p>13:07: The goal is super fast.</p><p>13:09: They aim to get every image from the telescope in Chile to the data center at SLAC within 7 seconds of the shutter closing.</p><p>13:15: 7 seconds for gigabytes of data.</p><p>13:18: Yeah.</p><p>13:18: Sometimes network traffic bumps it up to maybe 30 seconds or so, but the target is 7.</p><p>13:23: It’s crucial for the next step, which is making sense of it all.</p><p>13:27: How do astronomers actually use this, this torrent of images and data?</p><p>13:30: Right.</p><p>13:31: This really changes how astronomy might be done.</p><p>13:33: Because Ruben is designed to generate alerts, real-time notifications about changes in the sky.</p><p>13:39: Alerts like, hey, something just exploded over here.</p><p>13:42: Pretty much.</p><p>13:42: It takes an image compared to the previous images of the same patch of sky and identifies anything that’s changed, appeared, disappeared, moved, gotten brighter, or fainter.</p><p>13:53: It expects to generate about 10,000 such alerts per image.</p><p>13:57: 10,000 per image, and they take an image every every 20 seconds or so on average, including readouts. [Images are taken every 34 seconds: a 30 second exposure, and then about 4 seconds for the telescope to move and settle.]</p><p>14:03: So you’re talking around 10 million alerts every single night.</p><p>14:06: 10 million a night.</p><p>14:07: Yep.</p><p>14:08: And the goal is to get those alerts out to the world within 60 seconds of the image being taken.</p><p>14:13: That’s insane.</p><p>14:14: What’s in an alert?</p><p>14:15: It contains the object’s position, brightness, how it’s changed, and little cut out images, postage stamps in the last 12 months of observations, so astronomers can quickly see the history.</p><p>14:24: But surely not all 10 million are real astronomical events satellites, cosmic rays.</p><p>14:30: Exactly.</p><p>14:31: The observatory itself does a first pass filter, masking out known issues like satellite trails, cosmic ray hits, atmospheric effects, with what they call real bogus stuff.</p><p>14:41: OK.</p><p>14:42: Then, this filtered stream of potentially real alerts goes out to external alert brokers.</p><p>14:49: These are systems run by different scientific groups around the world.</p><p>14:52: Yeah, and what did the brokers do?</p><p>14:53: They ingest the huge stream from Ruben and apply their own filters, based on what their particular community is interested in.</p><p>15:00: So an astronomer studying supernovae can subscribe to a broker that filters just for likely supernova candidates.</p><p>15:06: Another might filter for near Earth asteroids or specific types of variable stars.</p><p>15:12: so it makes the fire hose manageable.</p><p>15:13: You subscribe to the trickle you care about.</p><p>15:15: Precisely.</p><p>15:16: It’s a way to distribute the discovery potential across the whole community.</p><p>15:19: So it’s not just raw images astronomers get, but these alerts and presumably processed data too.</p><p>15:25: Oh yes.</p><p>15:26: Rubin provides the raw images, but also fully processed images, corrected for instrument effects, calibrated called processed visit images.</p><p>15:34: And also template images, deep combinations of previous images used for comparison.</p><p>15:38: And managing all that data, 15 petabytes you mentioned, how do you query that effectively?</p><p>15:44: They use a system called Keyserve. [The system is "QServ."]</p><p>15:46: It’s a distributed relational database, custom built basically, designed to handle these enormous astronomical catalogs.</p><p>15:53: The goal is to let astronomers run complex searches across maybe 15 petabytes of catalog data and get answers back in minutes, not days or weeks.</p><p>16:02: And how do individual astronomers actually interact with it?</p><p>16:04: Do they download petabytes?</p><p>16:06: No, definitely not.</p><p>16:07: For general access, there’s a science platform, the front end of which runs on Google Cloud.</p><p>16:11: Users interact mainly through Jupiter notebooks.</p><p>16:13: Python notebooks, familiar territory for many scientists.</p><p>16:17: Exactly.</p><p>16:18: They can write arbitrary Python code, access the catalogs directly, do analysis for really heavy duty stuff like large scale batch processing.</p><p>16:27: They can submit jobs to the big compute cluster at SLEC, which sits right next to the data storage.</p><p>16:33: That’s much more efficient.</p><p>16:34: Have they tested this?</p><p>16:35: Can it handle thousands of astronomers hitting it at once?</p><p>16:38: They’ve done extensive testing, yeah, scaled it up with hundreds of users already, and they seem confident they can handle up to maybe 3000 simultaneous users without issues.</p><p>16:49: And a key point.</p><p>16:51: After an initial proprietary period for the main survey team, all the data and importantly, all the software algorithms used to process it become public.</p><p>17:00: Open source algorithms too.</p><p>17:01: Yes, the idea is, if the community can improve on their processing pipelines, they’re encouraged to contribute those solutions back.</p><p>17:08: It’s meant to be a community resource.</p><p>17:10: That open approach is fantastic, and even the way the images are presented visually has some deep thought behind it, doesn’t it?</p><p>17:15: You mentioned Robert Leptina’s perspective.</p><p>17:17: Yes, this is fascinating.</p><p>17:19: It’s about how you assign color to astronomical images, which usually combine data from different filters, like red, green, blue.</p><p>17:28: It’s not just about making pretty pictures, though they can be beautiful.</p><p>17:31: Right, it should be scientifically meaningful.</p><p>17:34: Exactly.</p><p>17:35: Lepton’s approach tries to preserve the inherent color information in the data.</p><p>17:40: Many methods saturate bright objects, making their centers just white blobs.</p><p>17:44: Yeah, you see that a lot.</p><p>17:46: His algorithm uses a different mathematical scaling, more like a logarithmic scale, that avoids this saturation.</p><p>17:52: It actually propagates the true color information back into the centers of bright stars and galaxies.</p><p>17:57: So, a galaxy that’s genuinely redder, because it’s red shifted, will actually look redder in the image, even in its bright core.</p><p>18:04: Precisely, in a scientifically meaningful way.</p><p>18:07: Even if our eyes wouldn’t perceive it quite that way directly through a telescope, the image renders the data faithfully.</p><p>18:13: It helps astronomers visually interpret the physics.</p><p>18:15: It’s a subtle but powerful detail in making the data useful.</p><p>18:19: It really is.</p><p>18:20: Beyond just taking pictures, I heard Ruben’s wide view is useful for something else entirely gravitational waves.</p><p>18:26: That’s right.</p><p>18:26: It’s a really cool synergy.</p><p>18:28: Gravitational wave detectors like Lego and Virgo, they detect ripples in space-time, often from emerging black holes or neutron stars, but they usually only narrow down the location to a relatively large patch of sky, maybe 10 square degrees or sometimes much more.</p><p>18:41: Ruben’s camera has a field of view of about 9.6 square degrees.</p><p>18:45: That’s huge for a telescope.</p><p>18:47: It almost perfectly matches the typical LIGO alert area.</p><p>18:51: so when LIGO sends an alert, Ruben can quickly scan that whole error box, maybe taking just a few pointings, looking for any new point of light.</p><p>19:00: The optical counterpart, the Killanova explosion, or whatever light accompany the gravitational wave event.</p><p>19:05: It’s a fantastic follow-up machine.</p><p>19:08: Now, stepping back a bit, this whole thing sounds like a colossal integration challenge.</p><p>19:13: A huge system of systems, many parts custom built, pushed to their limits.</p><p>19:18: What were some of those big integration hurdles, bringing it all together?</p><p>19:22: Yeah, classic system of systems is a good description.</p><p>19:25: And because nobody’s built an observatory quite like this before, a lot of the commissioning phase, getting everything working together involves figuring out the procedures as they go.</p><p>19:34: Learning by doing on a massive scale.</p><p>19:36: Pretty much.</p><p>19:37: They’re essentially, you know, teaching the system how to walk.</p><p>19:40: And there’s this constant tension, this balancing act.</p><p>19:43: Do you push forward, maybe build up some technical debt, things you know you’ll have to fix later, or do you stop and make sure every little issue is 100% perfect before moving on, especially with a huge distributed team?</p><p>19:54: I can imagine.</p><p>19:55: And you mentioned the dome motors earlier.</p><p>19:57: That discovery about heat affecting images sounds like a perfect example of unforeseen integration issues.</p><p>20:03: Exactly.</p><p>20:03: Marina Pavvich described that.</p><p>20:05: They ran the dome motors at full speed, something maybe nobody had done for extended periods in that exact configuration before, and realized, huh.</p><p>20:13: The heat these generate might actually cause enough air turbulence to mess with our image quality.</p><p>20:19: That’s the kind of thing you only find when you push the integrated system.</p><p>20:23: Lots of unexpected learning then.</p><p>20:25: What about interacting with the outside world?</p><p>20:27: Other telescopes, the atmosphere itself?</p><p>20:30: How does Ruben handle atmospheric distortion, for instance?</p><p>20:33: that’s another interesting point.</p><p>20:35: Many modern telescopes use lasers.</p><p>20:37: They shoot a laser up into the sky to create an artificial guide star, right, to measure.</p><p>20:42: Atmospheric turbulence.</p><p>20:43: Exactly.</p><p>20:44: Then they use deformable mirrors to correct for that turbulence in real time.</p><p>20:48: But Ruben cannot use a laser like that.</p><p>20:50: Why?</p><p>20:51: Because its field of view is enormous.</p><p>20:53: It sees such a wide patch of sky at once.</p><p>20:55: A single laser beam, even a pinpoint from another nearby observatory, would contaminate a huge fraction of Ruben’s image.</p><p>21:03: It would look like a giant streak across, you know, a quarter of the sky for Ruben.</p><p>21:06: Oh, wow.</p><p>21:07: OK.</p><p>21:08: Too much interference.</p><p>21:09: So how does it correct for the atmosphere?</p><p>21:11: Software.</p><p>21:12: It uses a really clever approach called forward modeling.</p><p>21:16: It looks at the shapes of hundreds of stars across its wide field of view in each image.</p><p>21:21: It knows what those stars should look like, theoretically.</p><p>21:25: Then it builds a complex mathematical model of the atmosphere’s distorting effect across the entire field of view that would explain the observed star shapes.</p><p>21:33: It iterates this model hundreds of times per image until it finds the best fit. [The model is created by iterating on the image data, but iteration is not necessary for every image.]</p><p>21:38: Then it uses that model to correct the image, removing the atmospheric blurring.</p><p>21:43: So it calculates the distortion instead of measuring it directly with a laser.</p><p>21:46: Essentially, yes.</p><p>21:48: Now, interestingly, there is an auxiliary telescope built alongside Ruben, specifically designed to measure atmospheric properties independently.</p><p>21:55: Oh, so they could use that data.</p><p>21:57: They could, but currently, they’re finding their software modeling approach using the science images themselves, works so well that they aren’t actively incorporating the data from the auxiliary telescope for that correction right now.</p><p>22:08: The software solution is proving powerful enough on its own.</p><p>22:11: Fascinating.</p><p>22:12: And they still have to coordinate with other telescopes about their lasers, right?</p><p>22:15: Oh yeah.</p><p>22:15: They have agreements about when nearby observatories can point their lasers, and sometimes Ruben might have to switch to a specific filter like the Iband, which is less sensitive to the laser.</p><p>22:25: Light if one is active nearby while they’re trying to focus.</p><p>22:28: So many interacting systems.</p><p>22:30: What an incredible journey through the engineering of Ruben.</p><p>22:33: Just the sheer ingenuity from the custom steel pier and the capacitor banks, the hexapods, that incredibly flat camera, the data systems.</p><p>22:43: It’s truly a machine built to push boundaries.</p><p>22:45: It really is.</p><p>22:46: And it’s important to remember, this isn’t just, you know, a bigger version of existing telescopes.</p><p>22:51: It’s a fundamentally different kind of machine.</p><p>22:53: How so?</p><p>22:54: By creating this massive all-purpose data set, imaging the entire southern sky over 800 times, cataloging maybe 40 billion objects, it shifts the paradigm.</p><p>23:07: Astronomy becomes less about individual scientists applying for time to point a telescope at one specific thing and more about statistical analysis, about mining this unprecedented ocean of data that Rubin provides to everyone.</p><p>23:21: So what does this all mean for us, for science?</p><p>23:24: Well, it’s a generational investment in fundamental discovery.</p><p>23:27: They’ve optimized this whole system, the telescope, the camera, the data pipeline.</p><p>23:31: For finding, quote, exactly the stuff we don’t know we’ll find.</p><p>23:34: Optimized for the unknown, I like that.</p><p>23:36: Yeah, we’re basically generating this incredible resource that will feed generations of astronomers and astrophysicists.</p><p>23:42: They’ll explore it, they’ll harvest discoveries from it, they’ll find patterns and objects and phenomena within billions and billions of data points that we can’t even conceive of yet.</p><p>23:50: And that really is the ultimate excitement, isn’t it?</p><p>23:53: Knowing that this monumental feat of engineering isn’t just answering old questions, but it’s poised to open up entirely new questions about the universe, questions we literally don’t know how to ask today.</p><p>24:04: Exactly.</p><p>24:05: So, for you, the listener, just think about that.</p><p>24:08: Consider the immense, the completely unknown discoveries that are waiting out there just waiting to be found when an entire universe of data becomes accessible like this.</p><p>24:16: What might we find?</p><p><a href="#listen-conversation-rubin-observatory">Back to top</a></p></div></div></br>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 04:01:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/vera-rubin-observatory-first-images</guid><category>Astronomy</category><category>Dark matter</category><category>Space</category><category>Telescopes</category><category>Type:cover</category><dc:creator>Evan Ackerman</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-researchers-inspect-a-large-telescope-system-inside-a-scientific-facility.jpg?id=61078903&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Video Friday: Jet-Powered Humanoid Robot Lifts Off</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-jet-powered-robot</link><description><![CDATA[

We’d have our one-on-one meetings to align on the priorities, and whether I should focus on new features or fix user-reported bugs.</span></p><p>But after a few days, our plans would suddenly change. Certain bugs would become the highest priority, especially if the order came from directors or VPs. I noticed a pattern where my manager would change his mind after speaking with a strong-willed project manager or some engineering leader up the chain.</p><p>I was left feeling confused and unsupported.</p><p>When this happens, how do you tell your manager to shape up? Is it even your responsibility to give feedback to your manager?</p><p>The 1:1 is a critical forum to share this kind of feedback. A 1:1 is a focused meeting between two people within the company, typically lasting 30 or 45 minutes. When done well, these meetings are a valuable tool for building trust and fostering <span>career</span> growth. In my experience, managers will have weekly or biweekly 1:1s with each of their reports. If you don’t have a regularly scheduled 1:1 with your manager, you’re missing out. Ask for one!</p><p>The effectiveness of a 1:1 depends on your preparation before the meeting. Here are a few ground rules I set with my reports and my own manager to make them as valuable as possible: </p><ul><li><strong>Write down the agenda in advance</strong>. This shows that you have put some thought into the meeting and, therefore, it shouldn’t be canceled. Keep a running doc of everything you’ve written down. It can be helpful for both you and your manager to refer back to prior discussions and action items.</li><li><strong>Avoid status updates</strong>. Approach each 1:1 as a valuable opportunity to learn something or gain a new perspective. Feel free to write down status updates ahead of time, but you should minimize the time spent in the 1:1 just reviewing statuses. The conversation should be more focused on emotions and concerns rather than obvious facts.</li><li><strong>Be vulnerable</strong>. One litmus test for the conversation is, “Could this have been shared in the broader team meeting?” If the answer is yes, don’t waste the valuable 1:1 time on that topic. The 1:1 should focus on the sticky human issues that inevitably come up in the workplace: losing motivation, feeling overwhelmed, or delivering difficult feedback, for example.</li></ul><p>At Meta, I used the 1:1 time with my manager to share my concerns about the constantly shifting priorities between new features and user-reported bugs. The problem didn’t get resolved overnight, but at least he was aware of the issue. I felt heard, and we continued to monitor the situation as it improved.</p><p>What if your manager isn’t receptive to your feedback or concerns? In almost all cases, it’s not worth trying to “fix” your manager or your environment.

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-women-analyzing-data-on-three-computer-screens-in-a-modern-workspace.jpg?id=61072467&width=1500&height=2000&coordinates=1020%2C0%2C1020%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>By analyzing neural signals, a brain-computer interface (BCI) can now almost instantaneously synthesize the speech of a man who lost use of his voice due to a neurodegenerative disease, a new study finds.</p><p>The researchers caution it will still be a long time before such a device, which could restore speech to paralyzed patients, will find use in everyday communication. Still, the hope is this work “will lead to a pathway for improving these systems further—for example, through technology transfer to industry,” says <a href="https://maitreyeew.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maitreyee Wairagkar</a>, a project scientist at the University of California Davis’s Neuroprosthetics Lab.</p><p>A major potential application for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robotics" target="_self">brain-computer interfaces</a> is restoring the ability to<strong> </strong>communicate to people who can no longer speak due to disease or injury. For instance, scientists have developed a number of BCIs that can help translate <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/braincomputer-interface-smashes-previous-record-for-typing-speed" target="_self">neural signals into text</a>.</p><p>However, text alone fails to capture many key aspects of human speech, such as intonation, that help to convey meaning. In addition, text-based communication is slow, Wairagkar says.</p><p>Now, researchers have developed what they call a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that can decode neural activity into sounds in real time. They detailed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09127-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their findings</a> 11 June in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>“Losing the ability to speak due to neurological disease is devastating,” Wairagkar says. “Developing a technology that can bypass the damaged pathways of the nervous system to restore speech can have a big impact on the lives of people with speech loss.”</p><h2>Neural Mapping for Speech Restoration</h2><p>The new BCI mapped neural activity using four microelectrode arrays. In total, the scientists placed 256 microelectrode arrays in three brain regions, chief among them the ventral precentral gyrus, which plays a key role in controlling the muscles underlying speech.</p><p>“This technology does not ‘read minds’ or ‘read inner thoughts,’” Wairagkar says. “We record from the area of the brain that controls the speech muscles. Hence, the system only produces voice when the participant voluntarily tries to speak.”</p><p>The researchers implanted the BCI in a 45-year-old volunteer with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS), the neurodegenerative disorder also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Although the volunteer could still generate vocal sounds, he was unable to produce intelligible speech on his own for years before the BCI.</p><p>The neuroprosthesis recorded the neural activity that resulted when the patient attempted to read sentences on a screen out loud. The scientists then trained a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/realtime-hologram" target="_self">deep-learning AI model</a> on this data to produce his intended speech.</p><p>The researchers also trained a voice-cloning AI model on recordings made of the patient before his condition so the BCI could synthesize his pre-ALS voice. The patient reported that listening to the synthesized voice “made me feel happy, and it felt like my real voice,” the study notes.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube"> <span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="607bfba9c1ebdc9e03874d7ef83bc6a4" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdfL5P4n6vc?rel=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"></iframe></span> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Neuroprosthesis Reproduces a Man’s Speech</small> <small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">UC Davis</small> </p><p>In experiments, the scientists found that the BCI could detect key aspects of intended vocal intonation. They had the patient attempt to speak sets of sentences as either statements, which had no changes in pitch, or as questions, which involved rising pitches at the ends of the sentences. They also had the patient emphasize one of the seven words in the sentence “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-sentence-with-7-meanings-unlocks-a-mystery-of-human-speech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I never said she stole my money</a>” by changing its pitch. (The sentence has seven different meanings, depending on which word is emphasized.) These tests revealed increased neural activity toward the ends of the questions and before emphasized words. In turn, this let the patient control his BCI voice enough to ask a question, emphasize specific words in a sentence, or sing three-pitch melodies.</p><p>“Not only what we say but also how we say it is equally important,” Wairagkar says. “Intonation of our speech helps us to communicate effectively.”</p><p>All in all, the new BCI could acquire neural signals and produce sounds with a delay of 25 milliseconds, enabling near-instantaneous speech synthesis, Wairagkar says. The BCI also proved flexible enough to speak made-up pseudo-words, as well as interjections such as “ahh,” “eww,” “ohh,” and “hmm.”</p><p>The resulting voice was often intelligible, but not consistently so. In tests where human listeners had to transcribe the BCI’s words, they understood what the patient said about 56 percent of the time, up from about 3 percent from when he did not use the BCI.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Computer screen displaying neural signal data in multiple graph plots." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a6610d42c204fca95be9c543fa52613f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="37c4f" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/computer-screen-displaying-neural-signal-data-in-multiple-graph-plots.jpg?id=61072472&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Neural recordings of the BCI participant shown on screen.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">UC Davis</small></p><p>“We do not claim that this system is ready to be used to speak and have conversations by someone who has lost the ability to speak,” Wairagkar says. “Rather, we have shown a proof of concept of what is possible with the current BCI technology.”</p><p>In the future, the scientists plan to improve the accuracy of the device—for instance, with more electrodes and better AI models. They also hope that BCI companies might start clinical trials incorporating this technology. “It is yet unknown whether this BCI will work with people who are fully locked in”—that is, nearly completely paralyzed, save for eye motions and blinking, Wairagkar adds.</p><p>Another interesting research direction is to study whether such speech BCIs could be useful for people with language disorders, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518" target="_blank">aphasia</a>. “Our current target patient population cannot speak due to muscle paralysis,” Wairagkar says. “However, their ability to produce language and cognition remains intact.” In contrast, she notes, future work might investigate restoring speech to people with damage to brain areas that produce speech, or with disabilities that have prevented them from learning to speak since childhood.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/bci-speech-synthesis</guid><category>Neuroprosthetic</category><category>Bci</category><category>Deep learning</category><category>Artificial intelligence</category><category>Brain computer interface</category><dc:creator>Charles Q.

The IEEE member sees her life as an example for other young people, demonstrating that they can succeed despite disadvantages they face due to their gender, ethnicity, language, or economic background.</p><p>Born in Cobán, the capital of Alta Verapaz in northern Guatemala, she grew up in a community far removed from the world of technology. But she attributes her success to having been steeped in the region’s cultural richness and her people’s unshakable resilience. The daughter of a single mother who was a schoolteacher, Caal says she spent her early years living with her aunts while her mother worked in distant towns for weeks at a time to provide for the family. In her community—mostly descendants of the indigenous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Maya-Kekchi</a> people—technology was rarely discussed. Pursuing a degree meant studying to become a physician, the most prestigious occupation anyone there was aware of.</p><p>No one imagined that a girl from Cobán would one day hold a doctorate in engineering or conduct cancer research in France.</p><p>On the path to her ambitious goals, Caal got a big assist from IEEE. She received a <a href="https://ieeesystemscouncil.org/awards/james-o-gray-scholarship" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gray scholarship</a>, awarded by the IEEE Systems Council to students pursuing graduate studies in process control systems engineering, plant automation, or instrumentation measurement. The US $5,000 award supplemented other scholarships which helped her to study for her Ph.D. </p><h2>Discovering robotics and mechatronics in high school</h2><p>Caal was introduced to technology when, at age 14, she received a government scholarship to attend the<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/school/intecapoficial/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Instituto Técnico de Capacitación y Productividad</a>, a high school in Guatemala City. It was her first exposure to electronics, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/" target="_self">robotics</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/houston-mechatronics-raises-20m-to-bring-nasa-expertise-to-transforming-robot-submersibles" target="_self">mechatronics</a> (an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science, and control systems)—subjects that weren’t taught in her local school. Caal was fascinated by the ability to study the fields, though her family couldn’t afford the tuition to the private universities where she could earn a degree. But that didn’t dissuade her.</p><h2>Pursuing a mechatronics career despite gender barriers</h2><p>She applied for a scholarship from<a href="https://fundacionjbg.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> the Gutiérrez Foundation</a>, named for the founder of <a href="https://somoscmi.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CMI</a>, a Guatemala-based multinational company. The foundation’s scholarship covers full tuition, fees, and the cost of books for the duration of a recipient’s undergraduate studies.</p><p>In 2016 Caal earned a bachelor’s degree in mechatronics engineering at the<a href="https://www.uvg.edu.gt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Universidad del Valle de Guatemala</a>, also in Guatemala City. There were few women in her class.</p><p>The job market was unwelcoming, however, she says. Despite her credentials, employers often required five years of experience for entry-level positions, and they expressed a preference for male employees, she says. It took six months to land her first job as a mechanical maintenance supervisor near her hometown.</p><p>She held that job for six months before moving back to Guatemala City in search of better opportunities. She took a position as head of mechanical maintenance at <a href="https://mayaprin.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mayaprin</a>, a company specializing in commercial printing services, but she wasn’t satisfied with her career trajectory.</p><h2>Earning an engineering education abroad</h2><p>Caal decided to return to school in 2018 to pursue a master’s degree in mechatronics and micromechatronics engineering. She received a scholarship from the<a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Mundus Joint Master</a> program, part of a European Commission–sponsored initiative that provides funding for education, training, and youth in sports. Because the Mundus scholarship requires recipients to study at several universities, she took classes at schools in Europe and Africa, including <a href="https://www.supmicrotech.fr/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques</a>, <a href="https://nu.edu.eg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nile University</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniovi.es/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universidad de Oviedo</a>. Her studies focused on mechatronics and microelectronics, and the courses were taught in French, English, and Spanish.</p><p>The multilingual challenge was immense, she says. She recently had learned English, and French was completely new to her. Yet she persevered, driven by her goal of working on technology that could serve humanity.</p><p>She received a master’s degree from Universidad de Oviedo in 2020 and was accepted into a Ph.D. program at <a href="https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/universite-bourgogne-franche-comte" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté</a>, in Besançon, France. Her doctoral studies  were mainly funded by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESRI), with additional support from the Gray scholarship..</p><p>Her research led to a full-time job last year as an R&D engineer focused on mechatronics and robotics at<a href="https://www.hyprview.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> HyprView</a> in Caen, France. The startup, founded in 2022, develops AI-enabled analysis tools to assist with medical data analysis.</p><p>Caal says she is part of a team that uses AI and automated systems to improve cancer detection. Although she has held the position for less than a year, she says she already feels she is contributing to public health through applied technology.</p><h2>IEEE support and STEM mentorship</h2><p>Through much of Caal’s journey, IEEE has played a critical role. As an undergraduate, she was vice president and then president of her university’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IEEEUVG/?locale=pt_PT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE student branch</a>. Her first international conference experience came from attending<a href="https://r9.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Region 9</a> conferences, which she says opened her eyes to the world of research, publishing, and the global engineering community.</p><p>She organized outreach efforts to local schools, conducting simple experiments to encourage girls to consider STEM careers. Her efforts were in direct opposition to longstanding gender norms in Guatemala. Caal was also an active member of the IEEE <a href="https://www.femto-st.fr/en/femto-st-student-chapter-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student branch at FEMTO-ST /Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté</a>.</p><p>Today, Caal continues to advise these student branches while advancing her career in France.</p><p>Language issues and gender bias remain obstacles: “As a young woman leading male engineers, I have repeatedly had to prove my competence in ways my male peers haven’t,” she says. But the challenges have only strengthened her resolve, she adds.</p><p>Eventually, she says, she hopes to return to Guatemala to help build a stronger research infrastructure there with sufficient career opportunities for tech professionals in industry and academia. She says she also wants to ensure that children in even the most rural, poverty-stricken schools have access to food, electricity, and the Internet.</p><p>Her mission is clear: “To use technology to serve a purpose, always aimed at improving lives.”</p><p>“I don’t want to create technology just for the sake of it,” she says. “I want it to mean something—to help solve real problems in society, like the ones I faced early on.” </p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/guatemalan-ai-engineer-cancer-research</guid><category>Cancer detection</category><category>Guatemala</category><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Ieee systems council</category><category>James o. gray scholarship</category><category>Mechatronics</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Willie D.

JPEG files degraded more gracefully than GIFs, retaining more of the picture’s initial form—and that allowed the format to scale to greater levels of success. While it wasn’t capable of animation, it progressively expanded from something a modem could pokily render to a format that was good enough for high-end professional photography.</p><p>For the Internet’s purposes, the degradation was the important part. But it wasn’t the only thing that made the JPEG immensely valuable to the digital world. An essential part was that it was a documented standard built by numerous stakeholders.</p><h2>The GIF was a de facto standard. The JPEG was an actual one</h2><p>How important is it that JPEG was a standard? Let me tell you a story.</p><p>During <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/an-honor-for-the-creator-of-the-gif/?smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank">a 2013 <em><em>New York Times</em></em> interview</a> conducted just before he received an award honoring his creation, GIF creator Steve Wilhite stepped into a debate he unwittingly created. <span>Simply put, nobody knew how to pronounce the acronym for the image format he had fostered, the Graphics Interchange Format. He used the moment to attempt to set the record straight—it was pronounced like the peanut butter brand: “It is a soft ‘G,’ pronounced ‘jif.’ End of story,” he said.</span></p><p>I <a href="https://shortformblog.com/post/51026114908/steve-wilhite-gif-award" target="_blank">posted a quote from Wilhite</a> on my popular Tumblr around that time, a period when the social media site was the center of the GIF universe. And soon afterward, my post got thousands of reblogs—nearly all of them disagreeing with Wilhite. Soon, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gif-vs-jif-pronunciation-debate/" target="_blank">Wilhite’s quote became a meme</a>.</p><p>The situation paints how Wilhite, who died in 2022, did not develop his format by committee. He could say it sounded like “JIF” because he built it himself. He was handed the project as a CompuServe employee in 1987; he produced the object, and that was that. The initial document describing how it works? <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif87.txt" target="_blank">Dead simple</a>. Thirty-eight years later, we’re still using the GIF—but it never rose to the same prevalence of JPEG.</p><p>The JPEG, which formally emerged about five years later, was very much <em><em>not</em></em> that situation. Far from it, in fact—it’s the difference between a de facto standard and an actual one. And that proved essential to its eventual ubiquity.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="Full-resolution photo of a sunlit pine forest with a narrow trail winding through the trees and grassy undergrowth." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="d5f40fd52d60e8ec21c06940db3febc7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="2999a" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/full-resolution-photo-of-a-sunlit-pine-forest-with-a-narrow-trail-winding-through-the-trees-and-grassy-undergrowth.jpg?id=61013768&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">We’re going to degrade the quality of this image throughout this article.

(Reflecting its committee-led roots, there would be no confusion about the format’s name—an acronym of the organization that designed it.) And when the format was finally unleashed on the world, it was the subject of a book that was more than 600 pages.</p><p><em><em>JPEG: Still Image Data Compression Standard</em></em>, written by IBM employees and JPEG organization stakeholders William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/JPEG/AepB_PZ_WMkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">describes</a> a landscape of multimedia imagery, held back without a way to balance the need for photorealistic images and immediacy. Standardization, they believed, could fix this.</p><p>“The problem was not so much the lack of algorithms for image compression (as there is a long history of technical work in this area),” the authors wrote, “but, rather, the lack of a standard algorithm—one which would allow an interchange of images between diverse applications.”</p><p>And they were absolutely right. For more than 30 years, JPEG has made high-quality, high-resolution photography accessible in operating systems far and wide. Although we no longer need to compress JPEGs to within an inch of their life, having that capability helped enable the modern Internet.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/JPEG/AepB_PZ_WMkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ibm+jpeg&pg=PA278&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">As the book notes</a>, Mitchell and Pennebaker were given IBM’s support to follow through this research and work with the JPEG committee, and that support led them to develop many of the JPEG format’s foundational patents. Described in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4905297" target="_blank">patents</a> filed by Mitchell and Pennebaker in 1988, IBM and other members of the JPEG standards committee, such as AT&T and Canon, were developing ways to use compression to make high-quality images easier to deliver in confined settings.</p><p>Each member brought their own needs to the process. Canon, obviously, was more focused on printers and photography, while AT&T’s interests were tied to data transmission. Together, the companies left behind a standard that has stood the test of time.</p><p>All this means, funnily enough, that the first place that a program capable of using JPEG compression appeared was not MacOS or Windows, but OS/2—a fascinating-but-failed graphical operating system created by Pennebaker and Mitchell’s employer, IBM. As early as 1990, OS/2 supported the format through the <a href="https://www.edm2.com/index.php/OS/2_Image_Support" target="_blank">OS/2 Image Support</a> application.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="Nearly identical photo of a sunlit pine forest." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="b810c6423ebd0b3e07f4d42c4c7162ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ef951" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/nearly-identical-photo-of-a-sunlit-pine-forest.jpg?id=61015732&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">At 50 percent of its initial quality, the image is down to about 2.6 MB.

The goal for a JPEG image is to still look like a photo when all is said and done, even if some compression is necessary to make it all work at a reasonable size. That way, you can display something that looks close to the original image in fewer bytes.</p><p>Or, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/JPEG/AepB_PZ_WMkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA4&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">as Pennebaker and Mitchell put it</a>, “the most effective compression is achieved by approximating the original image (rather than reproducing it exactly).”</p><p>Central to this is a compression process called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/compression-algorithms" target="_blank">discrete cosine transform</a> (DCT), a lossy form of compression encoding heavily used in all sorts of compressed formats, most notably in digital audio and signal processing. Essentially, it delivers a lower-quality product by removing details, while still keeping the heart of the original product through approximation. The stronger the cosine transformation, the more compressed the final result.</p><p>The algorithm, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1672377" target="_blank">developed by researchers</a> in the 1970s, essentially takes a grid of data and treats it as if you’re controlling its frequency with a knob. The data rate is controlled like water from a faucet: The more data you want, the higher the setting. DCT allows a trickle of data to still come out in highly compressed situations, even if it means a slightly compromised result. In other words, you may not keep all the data when you compress it, but DCT allows you to keep the heart of it.</p><p>(See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA" target="_blank">this video</a> for a more technical but still somewhat easy-to-follow description of DCT.)</p><p>DCT is everywhere. If you <a href="https://ottverse.com/discrete-cosine-transform-dct-video-compression/" target="_blank">have ever seen a streaming video</a> or an online radio stream that degraded in quality because your bandwidth suddenly declined, you’ve witnessed DCT being utilized in real time.</p><p>A JPEG file doesn’t have to leverage the DCT with just one method, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/JPEG/AepB_PZ_WMkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA81&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">as <em><em>JPEG: Still Image Data Compression Standard</em></em> explains</a>:</p><blockquote>The JPEG standard describes a family of large image compression techniques, rather than a single compression technique. It provides a “tool kit” of compression techniques from which applications can select elements that satisfy their particular requirements.</blockquote><p>The toolkit has four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Sequential DCT,</strong> which displays the compressed image in order, like a window shade slowly being rolled down</li><li><strong>Progressive DCT,</strong> which displays the full image in the lowest-resolution format, then adds detail as more information rolls in</li><li><strong>Sequential lossless,</strong> which uses the window-shade format but doesn’t compress the image</li><li><strong>Hierarchical mode,</strong> which combines the prior three modes—so maybe it starts with a progressive mode, then loads sequential lossless compression slowly, but then reaches a lossless final result</li></ul><p>At the time the JPEG was being created, modems were extremely common. That meant images loaded slowly, making Progressive DCT the most fitting format for the early Internet. Over time, the progressive DCT mode has become less common, as many computers can simply load the sequential DCT in one fell swoop.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="The same photo of a sunlit pine forest with very slight degradation visible." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="44d7f73d86c46d8ae4653970ebbffbdd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="fd0cd" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-same-photo-of-a-sunlit-pine-forest-with-very-slight-degradation-visible.jpg?id=61029700&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">That same forest, saved at 5 percent quality, now down to about 419 kilobytes.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Original image: Irina Iriser</small></p><p>When an image is compressed with DCT, the change tends to be less noticeable in busier, more textured areas of the picture, like hair or foliage. Those areas are harder to compress, which means they keep their integrity longer. It tends to be more noticeable, however, with solid colors or in areas where the image sharply changes from one color to another—like text on a page. Ever screenshot a social media post, only for it to look noisy? Congratulations, you just made a JPEG file.</p><p>Other formats, like PNG, do better with text, because their compression format is intended to be non-lossy. (Side note: PNG’s compression format, DEFLATE, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951" target="_blank">was designed</a> by Phil Katz, who also created the ZIP format. The PNG format uses it in part because it was a license-free compression format. So it turns out the brilliant coder with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB961363319756539141" target="_blank">sad life story</a> improved the Internet in multiple ways before his <a href="https://tedium.co/2015/02/17/early-internet-history-tales/" target="_blank">untimely passing</a>.)</p><p>In many ways, the JPEG is one tool in our image-making toolkit. Despite its age and maturity, it remains one of our best options for sharing photos on the Internet. But it is not a tool for every setting—despite the fact that, like a wrench sometimes used as a hammer, we often leverage it that way.</p><h2>Forgent Networks claimed to own the JPEG’s defining algorithm</h2><p>The JPEG format gained popularity in the ’90s for reasons beyond the quality of the format. Patents also played a role: Starting in 1994, the tech company Unisys <a href="https://www.theregister.com/1999/09/01/unisys_demands_5k_licence_fee/" target="_blank">attempted to bill individual users</a> who relied on GIF files, which used a patent the company owned. This made the free-to-use JPEG more popular. (This situation also led to the creation of the patent-free PNG format.)</p><p>While the JPEG was standards-based, it could still have faced the same fate as the GIF, thanks to the quirks of the patent system. A few years before the file format came to life, a pair of Compression Labs employees <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4698672A/en" target="_blank">filed a patent application</a> that dealt with the compression of motion graphics. By the time anyone noticed its similarity to JPEG compression, the format was ubiquitous.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="The same photo of a sunlit pine forest with more noticeable color degradation visible.

That’s the power of the JPEG.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Original image: Irina Iriser</small></p><p>Then in 1997, a company named Forgent Networks acquired Compression Labs. The company eventually spotted the patent and began filing lawsuits over it, a series of events it saw as a stroke of good luck.</p><p>“The patent, in some respects, is a lottery ticket,” Forgent CEO Jay Peterson <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/staking-a-claim-in-the-patent-gold-mine/" target="_blank">told <em><em>CNET</em></em> in 2005</a>. “If you told me five years ago that ‘You have the patent for JPEG,’ I wouldn’t have believed it.”</p><p>While Forgent’s claim of ownership of the JPEG compression algorithm was tenuous, it ultimately saw more success with its legal battles than Unisys did. The company earned more than US $100 million from digital-camera makers before the patent finally ran out of steam around 2007. The company also attempted to extract licensing fees from the PC industry. Eventually, Forgent agreed <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/forgent-settles-jpeg-patent-cases/" target="_blank">to a modest $8 million</a> settlement.</p><p>As the company took an increasingly aggressive approach to its acquired patent, it began to lose battles both in the court of public opinion and in actual courtrooms. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/05/6930-2/" target="_blank">Critics pounced on examples of prior art</a>, while courts limited the patent’s use to motion-based uses like video.</p><p>By 2007, Forgent’s compression patent expired—and its litigation-heavy approach to business went away. That year, the company became <a href="https://www.asuresoftware.com" target="_blank">Asure Software</a>, which now specializes in payroll and HR solutions. Talk about a reboot.</p><h2>Why the JPEG won’t die</h2><p>The JPEG file format has served us well. It’s been difficult to remove the format from its perch. The JPEG 2000 format, for example, was intended to supplant it by offering more lossless options and better performance. The format is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000143.shtml" target="_blank">widely used by the Library of Congress</a> and specialized sites like the Internet Archive; however, it is less popular as an end-user format.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Animated GIF of the forest images, starting at full resolution and progressing through increasingly degraded version of the iamge." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ea7ce7f87d0b7e0afed75e4a9a57e2a7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="171a2" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/animated-gif-of-the-forest-images-starting-at-full-resolution-and-progressing-through-increasingly-degraded-version-of-the-iamg.gif?id=61016209&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">See the forest JPEG degrade from its full resolution to 1 percent quality in this GIF. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Original image: Irina Iriser</small></p><p>Other image technologies have had somewhat more luck getting past the JPEG format. The Google-supported <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" target="_blank">WebP</a> is popular with website developers (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-why-you-have-to-deal-with-so-many-annoying-webps-now/" target="_blank">and controversial</a> with end users). Meanwhile, the formats <a href="https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/" target="_blank">AVIF</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/83650.html" target="_blank">HEIC</a>, each developed by standards bodies, have largely outpaced both JPEG and JPEG 2000.</p><p>Still, the JPEG will be difficult to kill at this juncture. These days, the format is similar to MP3 or ZIP files—two legacy formats too popular and widely used to kill. Other formats that compress the files better and do the same things more efficiently are out there, but it’s difficult to topple a format with a 30-year head start.</p><p>Shaking off the JPEG is easier said than done. I think most people will be fine to keep it around.</p><p><em><em>Ernie Smith is the editor of </em></em><a href="https://tedium.co/" target="_blank"><em><em>Tedium</em></em></a><em><em>, a long-running newsletter that hunts for the end of the long tail.</em></em></p><em><em><br/></em></em>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:45:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/jpeg-image-format-history</guid><category>Compression algorithms</category><category>Digital photography</category><category>Discrete cosine transform</category><category>Image compression</category><category>Jpeg</category><dc:creator>Ernie Smith</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/forest-scene-on-a-vintage-computer-screen-displaying-a-calm-wooded-area-at-daylight.jpg?id=61013743&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Why Pilots Will Matter in the Age of Autonomous Planes</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/autonomous-planes-certification</link><description><![CDATA[

Yet, the fundamental model of flying commercial <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/aircraft" target="_self">aircraft</a> hasn’t really changed. Passengers are still flown on large jetliners by two or more highly trained human pilots functioning as a team.</p><p>The main reason why airlines are still decades away from pilotless planes boils down to the strict regulatory framework for aviation. At the heart of this regulation is certification—the process by which governmental authorities determine that an aircraft design is safe for flight. Even for conventional aircraft based on proven technologies, taking a concept from design through certification can require hundreds of millions of dollars and the better part of a decade. Tack on any novel technologies, such as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomy" target="_self">autonomy</a> necessary to remove the pilot from the cockpit, and that process just gets longer and more expensive, with no guarantee of success.</p><p>Nevertheless, and despite the daunting odds against them, a new generation of startups is making a run at certifying autonomous passenger and cargo aircraft, in the process laying the groundwork for the next chapter of aviation. Instead of airliners, these companies are starting with small aircraft: electric air taxis and single-engine planes that typically seat fewer than a dozen people. Not only are the associated capital costs more manageable on a startup’s budget, there’s also a persuasive safety case to be made: Small aircraft are still prone to the types of accidents that have been largely eliminated from commercial airline operations. According to <a href="https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/air-safety-institute/accident-analysis/richard-g-mcspadden-report/mcspadden-report-figure-view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statistics</a> compiled by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, around 300 people die each year in small plane and helicopter crashes in the United States alone.</p><p>“Loss of control—mishandling the plane, usually as a result of disorientation or excessive workload—and controlled flight into terrain, [those] are the leading causes of accidents in small aircraft,” says <a href="https://reliable.co/company" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Rose</a>, cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://reliable.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reliable Robotics</a>, one of a few startups now working on retrofits that could enable Cessna Caravan planes to fly autonomously. A veteran of SpaceX and Tesla, Rose is adamant that “we, as a nation, possess the technology to prevent these accidents. If we can [autonomously] land a rocket on a small barge in the middle of the ocean, clearly we can find the centerline at an airport.”</p><h2>The economic case for autonomy in aviation</h2><p>While the safety argument for making small aircraft autonomous is a compelling one, the move is fundamentally rooted in economics. California-based Reliable Robotics and Massachusetts-based Merlin Labs are developing the commercial versions of their <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231206413888/en/Reliable-Robotics-Flies-Large-Cargo-Aircraft-with-No-One-On-Board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">autonomous Caravans</a> initially for the cargo feeder industry, which uses small airplanes to move packages to and from rural markets on behalf of carriers like FedEx and UPS. (Both companies also have <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240916015386/en/U.S.-Air-Force-Awards-Reliable-Robotics-Multi-Year-Contract-for-Dual-Use-Advanced-Aircraft-Automation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military funding</a> to develop autonomous aircraft.) Pilots for these feeder networks are typically flying alone, often at night and in bad weather, and <a href="https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2023-11-01/deeper-look-part-135-cargo-ops-accidents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their safety record is poor</a>. This is a comparatively low-volume segment of the aviation industry, and there’s no money for second pilots and other risk mitigations typical of airline operations.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A white airplane is parked on an airport tarmac close to a hangar.

The concept is called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-policy-strategy" target="_self">urban air mobility</a>, and in the speculative math that underpins it, eliminating the expense of a pilot and freeing up another seat for a paying passenger are seen as key to maximizing profits and scale.</p><p>China has already certified a pilotless air taxi: the EH216-S, a two-seat multicopter developed by Guangzhou-based <a href="https://www.ehang.com/" target="_blank">EHang</a> that in March <a href="https://www.ehang.com/news/1198.html" target="_blank">obtained initial approval</a> from the <a href="https://www.caac.gov.cn/English/" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Administration of China</a> for limited commercial sightseeing operations. However, many Western observers doubt that EHang’s design would pass muster by the U.S. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) or the <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/en" target="_blank">European Union Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA), both of which have an especially conservative approach to safety. For that reason, most Western eVTOL makers have opted to develop piloted aircraft first and plan to introduce autonomous versions at some later date. They figure that seeking certification of novel electric aircraft designs, even without autonomy, is already a big ask of these regulators.</p><p>A notable exception to this strategy is <a href="https://wisk.aero/" target="_blank">Wisk Aero</a>, which began as a project funded by Google cofounder Larry Page and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing. In January 2022, the company declared that it would obtain FAA certification for its self-flying air taxi by the end of the decade and be operating close to 14 million flights annually within five years after that—a staggering ambition, given that the entire U.S. air traffic system currently manages around 16 million flights per year. While overheated expectations around urban air mobility have cooled considerably in the three years since that announcement, Wisk continues to forge ahead with its autonomous <a href="https://wisk.aero/aircraft/" target="_blank">Generation 6 eVTOL</a>, the company’s sixth aircraft design and the first it plans to certify for passenger-carrying operations.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="a futuristic, bright yellow aircraft  sits on a large concrete pad with a blue sky in the background.

That means they’re working closely with the agency to define the rules and standards by which autonomous aircraft will be approved for commercial operations, blazing a trail for others to follow. The task is a daunting one, but the regulators and industry are not starting from scratch. Rather, they’re building on decades of certification experience and best practices that have helped to dramatically improve the safety of the aviation industry over its history.</p><h2>Aviation safety starts with certification</h2><p>Although the fatal January 2025 midair collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Eagle CRJ700 near Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National Airport <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/many-americans-are-losing-faith-safety-air-travel" target="_blank">shook public confidence</a> in the safety of the U.S. air transport system, commercial aviation remains a remarkably safe way to get around. According to researchers at MIT, the risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was just <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699724001066" target="_blank">one per 13.7 million passenger boardings</a> worldwide between 2018 and 2022. Fifty years earlier, the risk was an order of magnitude higher: one per 350,000 boardings between 1968 and 1977.</p><p>There are many reasons for this great leap in safety, and the certification process is an important one. Today, a majority of aviation accidents are attributed to human error, but that’s not because people are inherently less reliable than aircraft. It’s because a systematic approach to design and testing has over the past several decades eliminated many of the mechanical problems that used to cause accidents routinely. In this context, the argument for enhancing safety through autonomy can be thought of as transferring even more responsibilities from highly variable humans to engineered systems that can be subjected to greater scrutiny.</p><p>The overarching principle of certification is that the equipment and systems on an aircraft must be designed and installed so that they perform as intended during any foreseeable circumstances that they might encounter. “Perform as intended” includes <em><em>not</em></em> performing any <em><em>unintended</em></em> functions. An example of an unintended function is pushing the nose of an aircraft down past the level that a pilot can recover—that was the fatal result of a hidden software flaw that caused two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer" target="_self">crashes of the Boeing 737 Max</a> and led to an extended grounding of the fleet while that oversight was remedied.</p><p>Another key principle of certification is that the probability of a failure condition must be inversely proportional to its consequences. In other words, the more serious the impact of a failure, the more remote its chances of occurrence need to be. Aircraft are complex machines with millions of components that can and do fail, but many of these components can fail with no serious effects. For example, it’s no big deal if a lightbulb in the cabin burns out on a regular basis. Certifying authorities like the FAA generally accept a high probability of failure conditions that have a negligible impact on safety. However, failure conditions that are potentially catastrophic are required to be “extremely improbable.”</p><p>Whether a failure condition is extremely improbable is fundamentally a qualitative evaluation that relies on the best judgments of engineers about how a system is likely to fail, supported by numerical assessments of the likelihood of failure. The critical systems on large commercial airliners are held to a numerical safety level of 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span>, meaning that catastrophic failures are expected no more than once in a billion flight hours (the equivalent of once in about 114,000 years of continuous operation).</p><p>Achieving such vanishingly low probabilities may require expensive, heavy, and redundant systems, so regulators typically relax the safety expectations for small aircraft that carry fewer people. For example, a four-seat airplane like a Cessna 172 may only be held to a numerical safety level of 10<span><sup>-6</sup></span>, meaning that catastrophic failures are expected no more than once in a million flight hours. That said, aircraft manufacturers are free to design to higher standards, and Wisk is targeting the highest numerical safety level, 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span>, for its Gen 6 eVTOL.</p><p>These basic principles of certification apply regardless of whether or not there’s a human pilot sitting in the cockpit, which is why developers of autonomous aircraft are confident they don’t need to completely reinvent the certification framework.</p><p>“Everybody thinks that you need to think about the autonomy a different way than you would think about a piloted aircraft,” says <a href="https://wisk.aero/about/" target="_blank">Cindy Comer</a>, Wisk’s vice president of certification, safety management systems and quality. “But really we just don’t get to pass off these failure conditions to a pilot. We still do our safety assessment the same way. We still may design our aircraft in a very similar way, but it may be to higher levels, it may be with more redundancy, or maybe we add equipment, because we no longer have that person that can sit there and see the things, grab the things, to pull the breakers.</p><p>“So it drives our safety assessments to say, ‘Okay, we can’t put this on the pilot now. So what do we put it on?’”</p><h3>Key Aircraft Autonomy Projects</h3><br/><div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/23472514?820658"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img alt="table visualization" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23472514/thumbnail" width="100%"/></noscript></div>
<h2>Making autonomy certifiable presents unique challenges</h2><p>Answering that question—What do we put it on?—for every foreseeable failure condition is where the real work of certifying an autonomous aircraft comes in. Conventionally piloted aircraft may use the same overarching framework for certification, but they have the advantage of decades of certification history and precedent to fill in all of the details, down to requirements for such things as the actuation of the landing gear and the markings of instruments and placards. For the new systems on autonomous aircraft, many of those details must be negotiated with the FAA or some other certifying authority, which must be convinced in each instance that the proposed solution is at least as safe as the approach used on conventional aircraft.</p><p>In the United States, applicants for type certificates have considerable flexibility in proposing how to meet the FAA’s safety goals. For each project incorporating novel technologies, the applicant and the agency agree on a set of requirements and standards, which becomes the “regulatory basis” for that aircraft. Theoretically, each autonomous-aircraft developer could have a very different regulatory basis, although in practice, the FAA looks for common ground. Nevertheless, the flexibility in this approach allows industry to explore a variety of possible ways to comply with a certification requirement before a solution is codified in regulation.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img alt="A white single-engine airplane with a high wing is seen flying over scrubby brown terrain." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="996780adebb70d2a4a94c3b6f98569c5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="73873" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-white-single-engine-airplane-with-a-high-wing-is-seen-flying-over-scrubby-brown-terrain.jpg?id=60489677&width=980"/><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Merlin Labs launched the flight test campaign for its certification-ready autonomy system in June 2024. The Merlin Pilot system is integrated directly onto the aircraft and is intended in the near term to reduce crew workload rather than fully replace pilots.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Merlin Labs</small></p><p>“Once you have the regulatory basis in place, then you need to come to agreement on how you’re going to demonstrate compliance to all of those regulations,” says Rose. “You can pull from existing standards, you can modify existing standards, or you can, in some cases, even just propose your own standards.” After agreeing upon the means of compliance, the applicant and regulator develop a detailed project plan that outlines the tests that will be performed and the reports—known as artifacts—that will be submitted to the regulator to support certification.</p><p>For conventional piloted aircraft with a history of real-world operations, much of how those aircraft will function in the national airspace system is assumed. “Large commercial airplanes operate from airports around the world with relatively known and static equipment that helps them navigate and approach and land,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-yutko/" target="_blank">Brian Yutko</a>, until recently Wisk’s CEO (he now heads commercial airplane product development at Boeing). This infrastructure, he adds, has been established over decades and is reflected in the design of aircraft in ways that are often taken for granted.</p><p>The existing system relies heavily on human pilots communicating with air traffic controllers over radio. Autonomous aircraft will require new concepts of operations, or “ConOps,” for how they will function, which could include using ground supervisors to handle radio calls, for example. In turn, the specifics of each ConOps will influence aircraft design requirements. According to Comer, crystallizing the ConOps at the beginning of the certification process “helps drive a common understanding of what you’re actually doing, and that may be different for every applicant with the FAA.”</p><p>Basically, Wisk intends for its autonomous air taxi, which Yutko has likened to “a tram in the sky,” to fly along very specific and limited routes with predetermined emergency landing locations. Such a narrow set of tasks is an easier thing to automate than the varied and flexible operations performed by most small piloted aircraft today (or, for that matter, most self-driving cars). Meanwhile, human supervisors on the ground will monitor flights and communicate with air traffic control as required.</p><p>Reliable Robotics’ automated Cessna Caravans will also have remote operators to handle communications with air traffic control, but they will fly over a much larger and more variable operating area. Because of this added complexity, Reliable has opted to split up the work of certifying its autonomous aircraft into chunks, beginning with certification of an advanced, always-on autopilot. This will assist but not replace the onboard pilot during all phases of flight, including landing as well as taxi and takeoff—which traditional autopilots are not capable of. Taking the pilot out of the cockpit will come as a follow-on certification project.</p><h2>Autonomous aircraft will do what autopilots can’t</h2><p>Proponents of autonomy like to point out that most commercial airline flights today are flown on autopilot from shortly after takeoff until touchdown or just before. It may therefore seem surprising that Europe’s aviation regulator, EASA, <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications/easa-artificial-intelligence-roadmap-20" target="_blank">does not expect</a> to see fully autonomous airliners until after 2050, while other regulators haven’t even speculated on a timeline for the shift.</p><p>There are several reasons why “solving” autonomy in aircraft is not just a matter of expanding the functionality of existing autopilots. Basic flight control—moving flight-control surfaces and power inputs to make an aircraft fly how and where you want—is a relatively simple thing to automate, and most of the time, when everything goes as expected, autopilot works just fine. However, most existing autopilot systems assume there’s a human pilot, and for that reason they aren’t reliable enough to enable full autonomy.</p><p>“There are autopilot actuators that go into aircraft today,” notes Reliable cofounder Rose. “But there’s a person sitting there monitoring them, and if [the actuators] do anything funny, then you click the off switch or actually, in many cases, you can just physically overpower the actuator. That’s not the case with ours—our actuators need to work all the time.”</p><p>More challenging is solving for situations when everything does <em><em>not</em></em> go as expected, such as when another aircraft conflicts with the programmed flight path or a stray vehicle blocks the assigned runway. Autonomous-aircraft developers can’t count on a remote operator to manage these types of urgent, sudden conflicts, because the command-and-control (C2) link between the ground and the aircraft could also fail.</p><p>“The aircraft, without having a [pilot] on board, needs to know where it is, and how to get where it’s going and how to avoid things along the way, over the length of its concept of operations,” says Yutko. Wisk’s Gen 6 flier will have the ability to safely complete a flight even if it loses both its C2 link and GPS signal immediately after takeoff, he says. “It turns out that if you don’t do that, then you start to impose really difficult technical requirements on the C2 link, or on your ability to maintain GPS.”</p><p class="pull-quote">In the speculative math that underpins urban air mobility, eliminating the expense of a pilot and freeing up another seat for a paying passenger are seen as key to maximizing profits and scale.</p><p>Neither Wisk nor Reliable Robotics is using machine learning algorithms in its technical solutions, in large part because there’s no consensus on how to assure, to aviation’s exacting standards, the safety of such algorithms. These algorithms are frequently characterized as “nondeterministic,” meaning that their outputs can’t be reliably predicted from their inputs.</p><p>Some autonomous-aircraft developers are incorporating artificial intelligence into their designs. Merlin Labs, for example, is developing natural-language-processing algorithms to communicate with air traffic control. For the most part, however, autonomous-aircraft developers aren’t counting on technology alone to solve the innumerable contingencies that can arise in flight—that’s where the ground operators come in.</p><p>“We basically have taken everything that can be [automated] deterministically, and we’re making it deterministic,” Rose explains. “And all of the things that are…very hard to automate, that a human can do easily, then let the human do it.”</p><p>Which raises the question: If humans are required to supervise autonomous aircraft, does the business case for them still hold up? Their developers say it does, but in ways that aren’t as simple as just striking “pilots” from the balance sheet. For example, those remote supervisors will need training, but that’s likely to be far less extensive and costly than the training required to competently fly an aircraft. For Reliable Robotics and other companies targeting cargo delivery, autonomy also promises to improve the efficiency of the existing cargo feeder network.</p><p>“The reality is, in cargo aircraft, especially small cargo aircraft, pilots are super underutilized,” says Rose. Pilots at the feeder airlines may spend most of their day hanging out in a hotel room between their morning and evening flights. If people were instead managing autonomous cargo aircraft remotely, they could conceivably oversee additional flights across multiple time zones. “Our analysis has shown you can easily double the productivity of a pilot by putting them into our control center, potentially triple or quadruple the productivity [depending] on the mission set,” Rose says.</p><h2>Autonomous tech might eventually trickle up</h2><p>Even if companies like Wisk and Reliable Robotics succeed in certifying and commercializing their autonomous aircraft, human pilots still won’t face imminent extinction. Solving autonomy for one aircraft type and concept of operations doesn’t mean it’s solved for all types and concepts of operations. The technical, regulatory, and social barriers standing in the way of autonomous passenger jets are formidable.</p><p>“I think for as long as we’re all alive, there will be piloted large commercial aircraft,” Yutko says. “If you solve Gen 6, you don’t get uncrewed large airplanes. You just don’t, and I’m not certain that we will in our lifetimes.” However, he does think it likely that some of the technologies now being developed at Wisk—such as navigating in the absence of GPS or techniques for automating emergency checklists—will find their way into conventionally piloted aircraft in ways that enhance safety.</p><p>“I think those will be the types of things that we see in our lifetime benefiting big commercial transport applications, and I think it’s phenomenal,” adds Comer.</p><p>As for whether it makes sense for anyone to embark upon a career as an airline pilot under the looming shadow of autonomy, it probably still does, at least for now. But check back in another 20 years. <span class="ieee-end-mark"></span></p><p><em>This story was updated on 25 June to reflect the fact that Merlin Labs has a joint certification program with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority.</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/autonomous-planes-certification</guid><category>Autonomous systems</category><category>Aircraft certification</category><category>Autonomous aircraft</category><category>Autonomous passenger jets</category><category>Electric air taxis</category><category>Evtols</category><dc:creator>Elan Head</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electric-vertical-takeoff-aircraft-lifts-off-into-a-cloudy-sky-with-an-office-building-in-the-background.jpg?id=60489393&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Airbnb’s Dying Software Gets a Second Life</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/apache-airflow-3-programmatic-workflows</link><description><![CDATA[

He was working in the Internet of Things industry and searching for a solution to orchestrate sensor data using software. Airflow seemed to be a perfect fit, but Koka noticed the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source" target="_self">open-source</a> project’s stagnant state. Thus began a journey to breathe a second life into this dying software.</p><p>Airflow was the brainchild of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-secret-of-airbnbs-pricing-algorithm" target="_self">Airbnb</a>. The company created the system to <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link: https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8">automate and manage its data-related workflows</a>, such as cleaning and organizing datasets in its data warehouse and calculating metrics around host and guest engagement. In 2015, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link: https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8">Airbnb released the software as open source</a>. Then, four years later, Airflow transitioned into a <a href="https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces44" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top-level project</a> at the <a href="https://apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apache Software Foundation</a>, a leading developer and steward of open-source software.</p><p class="ieee-inbody-related"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-secret-of-airbnbs-pricing-algorithm" target="_blank">The Secret of Airbnb’s Pricing Algorithm</a></strong><br/></p><p>What was once a thriving project had stalled, however, with flat downloads and a lack of version updates. Leadership was divided, with some maintainers focusing on other endeavors.</p><p>Yet Koka believed in the software’s potential. Unlike static configuration files, Airflow follows the principle of “configuration as code.” Workflows are represented as <a href="https://networkx.org/nx-guides/content/algorithms/dag/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directed acyclic graphs</a> of tasks—a graph with directed edges and no loops. Developers can code these tasks in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/python" target="_self">Python</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming-languages" target="_self">programming language</a>, allowing them to import libraries and other dependencies that can help them better define tasks. Akin to a musical conductor, Airflow orchestrates the symphony of tasks and manages the scheduling, execution, and monitoring of workflows.</p><p>This flexibility is what caught Koka’s eye. “I fell in love with the concept of code-first pipelines—pipelines which could actually be deployed in code,” he says. “The whole notion of programmatic workflows really appealed to me.”</p><p>Koka started work righting the Airflow ship. As an open-source contributor with decades of experience in the data and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineering" target="_self" title="Link: https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineering">software-engineering</a> space, he connected with people in the community to fix bugs around reliability and craft other enhancements. It took a year, but Airflow 2.0 was released in December 2020.</p><h2>Airflow’s Growth and Community Expansion</h2><p>The release served as a crucial turning point for the project. Downloads from its <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> increased, and more enterprises adopted the software. Encouraged by this growth, the team envisioned the next generation of Airflow: a modular architecture, a more modern user interface, and a “run anywhere, anytime” feature, enabling it to operate on premises, in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cloud-computing" target="_self">cloud</a>, or on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/edge" target="_self">edge</a> devices and handle event-driven and ad hoc scenarios in addition to scheduled tasks. The team delivered on this vision with the launch of Airflow 3.0 last April.</p><p>“It was amazing that we managed to ‘rebuild the plane while flying it’ when we worked on Airflow 3—even if we had some temporary issues and glitches,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarekpotiuk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jarek Potiuk</a>, one of the foremost contributors to Airflow and now a member of its project-management committee. “We had to refactor and move a lot of pieces of the software while keeping Airflow 2 running and providing some bug fixes for it.”</p><p>Compared with Airflow’s second version, which Koka says had only a few hundred to a thousand downloads per month on GitHub, “now we’re averaging somewhere between 35 to 40 million downloads a month,” he says. The project’s community also soared, with more than 3,000 developers of all skill levels from around the world contributing to Airflow.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jens-scheffler/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jens Scheffler</a> is an active part of that community. As a technical architect of digital testing automation at <a href="https://www.bosch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bosch</a>, his team was one of the early adopters of Airflow, using the software to orchestrate tests for the company’s automated driving systems.</p><p>Scheffler was inspired by the openness and responsiveness of Airflow members to his requests for guidance and support, so he considered “giving back something to the community—a contribution of code.” He submitted a few patches at first, then implemented an idea for a feature that would benefit not only his team but other Airflow users as well. Scheffler also discovered other departments within Bosch employing Airflow, so they’ve formed a small in-house community “so we can exchange knowledge and keep in touch.”</p><p>Koka, who is also a member of Airflow’s project-management committee and a chief strategy officer at the data-operations platform <a href="https://www.astronomer.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Astronomer</a>, notes that managing a huge group of contributors is challenging, but nurturing that network is as essential as improving the software. The Airflow team has established a system that enables developers to contribute gradually, starting with documentation and then progressing to small issues and bug fixes before tackling larger features. The team also makes it a point to swiftly respond and provide constructive feedback.</p><p>“For many of us in the community, [Airflow] is an adopted child. None of us were the original creators, but we want more people feeling they’ve also adopted it,” says Koka. “We’re in different organizations, in different countries, speak different languages, but we’re still able to come together toward a certain mission. I love being able to do that.”</p><h2>Future of Airflow in AI and Machine Learning</h2><p>The Airflow team is already planning future features. This includes tools to write tasks in programming languages other than Python, human-in-the-loop capabilities to review and approve tasks at certain checkpoints, and support for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning" target="_self">machine learning</a> workflows. According to <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-survey-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airflow’s 2024 survey</a>, the software has a rising number of use cases in machine learning operations (MLOps) and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/generative-ai" target="_self">generative AI</a>.</p><p>“We are at a pivotal moment where AI and ML workloads are the most important things in the IT industry, and there is a great need to make all those workloads—from training to inference and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents" target="_self">agentic</a> processing—robust, reliable, scalable, and generally have a rock-solid foundation they can run on,” Potiuk says. “I see Airflow as such a foundation.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/apache-airflow-3-programmatic-workflows</guid><category>Software</category><category>Open source</category><category>Ai</category><category>Airbnb</category><dc:creator>Rina Diane Caballar</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/pixel-art-of-four-pinwheels.jpg?id=60930318&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Why the Semiconductor Industry Can’t Abandon Women</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/women-in-semiconductors-workforce</link><description><![CDATA[

At the same time, fewer of these companies were publicly committed to equal opportunity measures in 2024 than the year prior, the same report found.</p><p>This lack of support comes at the same time that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/workforce-shortage" target="_blank">major workforce shortages</a> are expected, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamohamed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrea Mohamed</a><span>, COO and co-founder of </span><a href="https://quantumbloom.com/" target="_blank">QuantumBloom</a><span>, which helps companies attract, retain, and advance early career women in STEM. The company</span><span style="background-color: initial;"> focuses on the transition from higher education to the workforce, a critical point during which many women leave STEM.</span></p><p><span><em><span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></span></em> spoke to Mohamed about supporting women in semiconductor jobs, and why a retreat from these initiatives is at odds with the needs of the industry. </span></p><p class="rm-anchors" id="top"><span>Andrea Mohamed on: </span></p><ul><li><a href="#perspective">The current state of the semiconductor industry</a></li><li><a href="#support">How a lack of support for women will impact the industry</a></li><li><a href="#regress">Whether the industry is regressing in its hiring practices</a></li><li><a href="#lesson">What the semiconductor industry can learn from other industries</a></li></ul><p><strong>Tell me about your perspective as a returning veteran of the semiconductor industry.</strong></p><p class="rm-anchors" id="perspective"><strong>Andrea Mohamed: </strong>I worked for a semiconductor startup company over 20 years ago, and it was very male dominated. Now, it’s still very male dominated. Seeing the semiconductor industry with fresh eyes, what I see is an industry that hasn’t evolved as quickly as other STEM-intensive industries. I’ve worked for science and research-oriented organizations, and the progress that’s been made in other sectors just hasn’t been made in this particular sector. </p><p><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p><p class="rm-anchors" id="support"><strong>How might the lack of support for women in the U.S. semiconductor industry create additional problems?</strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>On a macro scale, you have an industry that is facing a lot of geopolitical and economic forces that are disrupting the whole supply chain ecosystem around semiconductors, and there’s a push to reshore and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona" target="_blank">onshore</a>. There are a lot of infrastructure gaps in doing that, one of them being <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-workforce-development" target="_blank">the workforce component</a>. It’s not just semiconductors that are poised to be reshored and onshored to the United States; it’s also pharmaceuticals and automotive. And all of that is going to continue to put pressure on the supply and demand curve, if you will, around labor.</p><p>There’s been an enormous amount of attention on the STEM <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-design-enrollment" target="_blank">education</a> pipeline, and rightfully so. China and India are producing STEM graduates at a rate that we are not keeping pace with. While we’ve had that focus on the STEM education pipeline, there’s been very little focused attention on what industry is doing inside companies to address the workforce challenges. </p><p>There is a lot of additional concern around corporate cultures, burn-and-churn cyclical nature, policies that seem out of date relative to other industries, including as it relates to child care. Industry is very clearly articulating to education what it needs the next generation to have <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-microcredential-program" target="_blank">from a skills perspective</a>. But we don’t see the voice of the next generation worker influencing how industry is attracting them. We’ve got to start to see the industry recognize how it’s in its own way when it comes to workforce development.</p><p><strong>It sounds like the problem goes beyond the “leaky pipeline” that’s often discussed. </strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>Right. We keep talking about the leaky pipeline for all these stages of women dropping out. It starts in middle school, when girls’ interest and confidence in STEM start to wane. At every stage there’s a leak. And then you get to this early career stage, which QuantumBloom is focused on, and that bucket is gushing. We’re losing a ton, and we’re all thinking about just putting more water in the bucket, when really, we need to fix the holes. There’s a lot of discussion about what it’s going to take to attract women, people of color, other communities into the semiconductor workforce, and very little on fixing the holes.</p><p><span>Oftentimes the early career experience is pretty much sink or swim for everybody, regardless of gender. We know with women, it’s more likely that they leave.</span></p><p><span><a href="#top">Return to top</a></span></p><p class="rm-anchors" id="regress"><strong>I understand that the semiconductor industry may actually be regressing in these areas. Can you talk about that? </strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>The latest report that came out from <a href="https://www.gsaglobal.org/about-gsa/" target="_blank">Global Semiconductor Alliance</a> and Accenture <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/high-tech/women-semiconductor-leadership" target="_blank">on the state of women and semiconductors</a>, to me, is like a canary in a coal mine. We’re seeing a decrease in public commitments for diversity and the progress that we’ve made around programs that support women. It’s counterintuitive that we are decreasing support at exactly the time we need to be attracting this audience into the industry. </p><p>I understand the pressures that companies are facing around anything that’s related to DEI. We need to change the conversation from DEI to talent management. This is retention and avoiding turnover costs. This is about needing every available brilliant mind in the United States that wants to be in semiconductors. We have offshored this industry for so long. Other countries have existing talent bases. We have to build it.</p><p><strong>So the industry should work on these initiatives to build better workplaces, regardless of whether they’re labeled as promoting diversity?</strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>I think a lot of DEI activity was performative. A lot of companies were really not committed to creating great workplaces for everybody. I think that’s part of the reason DEI has gotten politicized. There’s this notion that people were given opportunities that weren’t based on merit. What I’m saying is that this is not a merit conversation, right? <span>Women are graduating with bachelor’s degrees <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/18/us-women-are-outpacing-men-in-college-completion-including-in-every-major-racial-and-ethnic-group/" target="_blank">at a rate higher than men</a> and increasing. </span><span>Really, this is about human capital development. You have women who are opting out of your industry, </span><span>a</span><span>nd you have to recognize and pay attention to the unique lived experience of women in these environments in order to solve the problem.</span></p><p>So there are semantics in all of this, but it’s not just relabeling. This is about business. You are not going to be able to compete on a global stage in the United States if you are not finding ways to attract and retain new communities of workers, and women are one of those communities. That means understanding what women need from their employer, because if you do not provide it, they will go somewhere else that does. The concern by companies about, if they run a program like QuantumBloom, does that create a risk? It’s the wrong question about risk. Your big risk is that your fab is empty, because you can’t find workers and retain them. </p><p><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p><p class="rm-anchors" id="lesson"><strong>What have you observed in other industries, and what can semiconductor leaders learn from them?</strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>Many women whose roots are in engineering end up working potentially in a technical organization, but not in a technical role. You see them also pivot into completely different industries. They go to business school, they become a consultant, they go to law school. </p><p>In other industries, there are organizations that are very intentional about attracting and retaining their youngest talent. They are dedicating resources to investing in them, which is very rare—most organizations invest more the higher up you go. Really, we need to be thinking about flipping that script and investing more sooner. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"> <img alt="Woman with long blonde hair in a blue blouse against a solid blue background." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="05250695ff2c19a019192f1b48040ead" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ac967" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/woman-with-long-blonde-hair-in-a-blue-blouse-against-a-solid-blue-background.jpg?id=61009402&width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Andrea Mohamed is COO and co-founder of QuantumBloom, a professional development company focused on women in STEM.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Andrea Mohamed</small></p><p>When I think about employer-led solutions around early career talent, what comes to mind are apprenticeships, rotational programs, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses" target="_blank">leadership skill development</a>—all the things you’re not taught in school but that are really important to your success. <span>These are skills that you take with you for an entire career. </span><span>When you invest in the top, most of the time people say, “I wish I had this in my 20s.” </span><span>I don’t see m</span><span>any</span><span> of th</span><span>ese solutions</span><span> being used</span><span> in this industry. I heard recently one of the big semiconductor giants in this country used to have an engineering rotational program and stopped it five years ago. I was talking to a person who had been in that program and how pivotal it was in their early career experience. </span></p><p><strong>Are there other steps that you think are important for semiconductor leaders to take?</strong></p><p><strong>Mohamed: </strong>The things that QuantumBloom solves are very early career and focused on individuals. At the same time, companies need to be thinking about top-down culture change and industry transformation. Those are longer-term horizon things to fix. </p><p>People join companies and quit bosses. The relationship with your boss is so important. You can be in a relatively terrible organization culturally and have a wonderful boss, and you can have career success. Vice versa, you could be in an awesome corporate culture with a terrible boss and not thrive. If we can improve that primary work relationship, build more empathy for each other’s experiences at a local level, we can improve work outcomes and retention. And then things start to spread. That manager who may be supporting a particular woman in our program, they learn skills and tools to be more inclusive leaders that extends beyond just that woman. </p><p>We’re doing that more at that local level, but man, companies really need to be addressing top-down transformation and culture change. <span>At the end of the day, we need semiconductor leaders to envision becoming a magnet for all talent, and then commit the resources and organizational changes needed to make that vision reality.</span></p><p><span><a href="#top">Return to top</a></span></p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 14:56:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/women-in-semiconductors-workforce</guid><category>Culture</category><category>Semiconductor industry</category><category>Women in engineering</category><category>Workforce development</category><dc:creator>Gwendolyn Rak</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-gloved-hand-holding-a-computer-chip-against-a-gradient-background.jpg?id=61009400&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Europe’s Plan for Faster Space Travel</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/esa-nuclear-rocket</link><description><![CDATA[

This is because regular rocket engines burn fuel and oxygen together (like a car engine), but they’re not very efficient. The fundamental problem is that spacecraft must carry both fuel and oxidizer since there’s no air in space to support combustion. This creates a vicious circle: The more fuel you carry to go faster, the heavier your spacecraft becomes, requiring even more fuel to accelerate that extra weight. To go faster, you’d need massive amounts of fuel, making the rockets incredibly expensive and heavy. Current chemical propulsion systems are just about at their theoretical limits, with little room for improvement in efficiency.</span></p><p class="ieee-inbody-related"><span><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/rockets-for-the-red-planet" target="_blank">Rockets for the Red Planet</a></strong><br/></span></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/"></a><a class="shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons" title="Select for lightbox">aspect_ratio</a><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/" target="_blank"><img alt='Universe Today logo; text reads "This post originally appeared on Universe Today."' class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="087bc0ad57330681cee5d3354f3d2ac7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b9dd2" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&width=980"/></a></p><p>Whilst <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/5-things-in-trumps-budget-that-wont-make-nasa-great-again/" target="_blank">NASA funding has been slashed</a> by the Trump administration with no allocation for <a data-linked-post="2652903460" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-rockets-get-a-second-look-for-travel-to-mars" target="_blank">nuclear thermal propulsion</a> and/or nuclear electric propulsion, scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) have been studying nuclear propulsion. Here’s how it works: Instead of burning fuel with oxygen, a nuclear reactor heats up a propellant like hydrogen. The super-heated propellant then shoots out of the rocket nozzle, pushing the spacecraft forward. This method is much more efficient than chemical rockets.</p><h2>Revisiting Nuclear Rockets for Mars</h2><p>Nuclear rockets offer several key advantages, such as cutting Mars trip times in half—from nine months to about four to five months. The efficiency gains come from the fact that nuclear reactors produce far more energy per unit of fuel than chemical reactions. Surprisingly, astronauts would actually receive less harmful radiation on shorter trips, even though the engine itself produces radiation. This happens because space travelers are constantly bombarded by cosmic radiation during their journey, and cutting travel time in half significantly reduces their total exposure. These engines work best for big spacecraft that need to speed up and slow down dramatically, perfect for moon and Mars missions where rapid velocity changes of at least 25,000 km/h are required.</p><p>The study, called <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/06/Alumni_nuclear_thermal_propulsion_system_schematic" target="_blank">“Alumni,”</a> prioritized safety through careful design. The nuclear reactor only turns on when the spacecraft is far from Earth in a safe orbit. Before activation, the uranium fuel has very low radioactivity and isn’t toxic. Multiple radiation shields protect the crew during the short engine burns that last less than two hours. The reactor is designed never to return to Earth’s atmosphere. The research team spent over a year analyzing this technology and concluded it’s feasible for long-term development. However, there’s still significant work ahead, including laboratory testing of the new ceramic-metal reactor design, building safe testing facilities, and solving technical challenges like fuel sourcing and reactor restart systems.</p><p>Nuclear thermal propulsion could revolutionize space travel, making missions to Mars and the moon faster and more practical. While the technology is promising and appears safe, it will take many years of development before we see nuclear-powered spacecraft heading to the Red Planet. It’s great to see Europe demonstrating that it has the expertise to develop this technology, potentially ushering in a new era of space exploration where distant worlds become more accessible than ever before.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/esa-nuclear-rocket</guid><category>Rockets</category><category>Mars</category><category>Esa</category><category>Nasa</category><dc:creator>Mark Thompson</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/schematic-collage-of-an-alumni-nuclear-thermal-propulsion-system-surrounded-by-a-dark-starry-sky.jpg?id=60934597&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Video Friday: AI Model Gives Neo Robot Autonomy</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-neo-humanoid-robot</link><description><![CDATA[

<strong>The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost" target="_self">unsustainable trajectory</a>. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Andrew Ng: </strong>This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions.
</p><p>
<strong>When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> This is a term coined by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a> and <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of my friends at Stanford</a> to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-ais-powerful-text-generating-tool-is-ready-for-business" target="_self">GPT-3</a> is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them.
</p><p>
<strong>What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision.
</p><p>
	Having said that, a lot of what’s happened over the past decade is that deep learning has happened in consumer-facing companies that have large user bases, sometimes billions of users, and therefore very large data sets. While that paradigm of machine learning has driven a lot of economic value in consumer software, I find that that recipe of scale doesn’t work for other industries.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Brain</a> project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation.

	“In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.”<br/>
	—Andrew Ng, CEO & Founder, Landing AI
</p><p>
	I remember when my students and I published the first 
	<a href="https://nips.cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NeurIPS</a> workshop paper advocating using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CUDA</a>, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince.
</p><p>
<strong>I expect they’re both convinced now.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think so, yes.
</p><p>
	Over the past year as I’ve been speaking to people about the data-centric AI movement, I’ve been getting flashbacks to when I was speaking to people about deep learning and scalability 10 or 15 years ago. In the past year, I’ve been getting the same mix of “there’s nothing new here” and “this seems like the wrong direction.”
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data.
</p><p>
	When I started speaking about this, there were many practitioners who, completely appropriately, raised their hands and said, “Yes, we’ve been doing this for 20 years.” This is the time to take the things that some individuals have been doing intuitively and make it a systematic engineering discipline.
</p><p>
	The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a 
	<a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS</a>, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up.
</p><p>
<strong>You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RetinaNet</a>. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.”<br/>
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance.
</p><p>
<strong>Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olga Russakovsky</a> gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/22281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Gray’s presentation,</a> which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/datasheets-for-datasets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a> also seem like an important piece of the puzzle.
</p><p>
	One of the powerful tools that data-centric AI gives us is the ability to engineer a subset of the data. Imagine training a machine-learning system and finding that its performance is okay for most of the data set, but its performance is biased for just a subset of the data. If you try to change the whole neural network architecture to improve the performance on just that subset, it’s quite difficult. But if you can engineer a subset of the data you can address the problem in a much more targeted way.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jupyter notebook</a> and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.
</p><p>
	For example, I once figured out that a speech-recognition system was performing poorly when there was car noise in the background. Knowing that allowed me to collect more data with car noise in the background, rather than trying to collect more data for everything, which would have been expensive and slow.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar</a> gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development.
</p><p>
<strong>Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models.”<br/>
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data.

<strong>To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches <a href="https://landing.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Landing AI</a> and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment?</strong>

<strong>Ng: </strong>When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the <a href="https://landing.ai/platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LandingLens</a> platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data.
</p><p>
	One of the foci of Landing AI is to empower manufacturing companies to do the machine learning work themselves. A lot of our work is making sure the software is fast and easy to use. Through the iterative process of machine learning development, we advise customers on things like how to train models on the platform, when and how to improve the labeling of data so the performance of the model improves. Our training and software supports them all the way through deploying the trained model to an edge device in the factory.
</p><p>
<strong>How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations.
</p><p>
	In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models. The challenge is, how do you do that without Landing AI having to hire 10,000 machine learning specialists?
</p><p>
<strong>So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains.
</p><p>
<strong>Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

Engineers and designers can do only so much to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-introduces-the-worlds-first-2nm-node-chip" target="_self">miniaturize transistors</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-giant-ai-chip-now-has-a-trillions-more-transistors" target="_self">pack as many of them as possible into chips</a>. So they’re turning to other approaches to chip design, incorporating technologies like AI into the process.</p><p>Samsung, for instance, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/processing-in-dram-accelerates-ai" target="_self">adding AI to its memory chips</a> to enable processing in memory, thereby saving energy and speeding up machine learning. Speaking of speed, Google’s TPU V4 AI chip has <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/heres-how-googles-tpu-v4-ai-chip-stacked-up-in-training-tests" target="_self">doubled its processing power</a> compared with that of  its previous version.</p><p>But AI holds still more promise and potential for the semiconductor industry. To better understand how AI is set to revolutionize chip design, we spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-gorr-phd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heather Gorr</a>, senior product manager for <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MathWorks</a>’ MATLAB platform.</p><p><strong>How is AI currently being used to design the next generation of chips?</strong></p><p><strong>Heather Gorr:</strong> AI is such an important technology because it’s involved in most parts of the cycle, including the design and manufacturing process. There’s a lot of important applications here, even in the general process engineering where we want to optimize things. I think defect detection is a big one at all phases of the process, especially in manufacturing. But even thinking ahead in the design process, [AI now plays a significant role] when you’re designing the light and the sensors and all the different components. There’s a lot of anomaly detection and fault mitigation that you really want to consider.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;">

So, looking back at that historical data of when you’ve had those moments where maybe it took a bit longer than expected to manufacture something, you can take a look at all of that data and use AI to try to identify the proximate cause or to see  something that might jump out even in the processing and design phases. We think of AI oftentimes as a predictive tool, or as a robot doing something, but a lot of times you get a lot of insight from the data through AI.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Historically, we’ve seen a lot of physics-based modeling, which is a very intensive process. We want to do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduced order model</a>, where instead of solving such a computationally expensive and extensive model, we can do something a little cheaper. You could create a surrogate model, so to speak, of that physics-based model, use the data, and then do your <a href="https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/idmtools/parameter-sweeps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parameter sweeps</a>, your optimizations, your <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulations</a> using the surrogate model. That takes a lot less time computationally than solving the physics-based equations directly. So, we’re seeing that benefit in many ways, including the efficiency and economy that are the results of iterating quickly on the experiments and the simulations that will really help in the design.</p><p><strong>So it’s like having a digital twin in a sense?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Exactly. That’s pretty much what people are doing, where you have the physical system model and the experimental data. Then, in conjunction, you have this other model that you could tweak and tune and try different parameters and experiments that let sweep through all of those different situations and come up with a better design in the end.</p><p><strong>So, it’s going to be more efficient and, as you said, cheaper?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Especially in the experimentation and design phases, where you’re trying different things. That’s obviously going to yield dramatic cost savings if you’re actually manufacturing and producing [the chips]. You want to simulate, test, experiment as much as possible without making something using the actual process engineering.</p><p><strong>We’ve talked about the benefits. How about the drawbacks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>The [AI-based experimental models] tend to not be as accurate as physics-based models. Of course, that’s why you do many simulations and parameter sweeps. But that’s also the benefit of having that digital twin, where you can keep that in mind—it’s not going to be as accurate as that precise model that we’ve developed over the years.</p><p>Both chip design and manufacturing are system intensive; you have to consider every little part. And that can be really challenging. It’s a case where you might have models to predict something and different parts of it, but you still need to bring it all together.</p><p>One of the other things to think about too is that you need the data to build the models. You have to incorporate data from all sorts of different sensors and different sorts of teams, and so that heightens the challenge.</p><p><strong>How can engineers use AI to better prepare and extract insights from hardware or sensor data?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>We always think about using AI to predict something or do some robot task, but you can use AI to come up with patterns and pick out things you might not have noticed before on your own. People will use AI when they have high-frequency data coming from many different sensors, and a lot of times it’s useful to explore the frequency domain and things like data synchronization or resampling. Those can be really challenging if you’re not sure where to start.</p><p>One of the things I would say is, use the tools that are available. There’s a vast community of people working on these things, and you can find lots of examples [of applications and techniques] on <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MATLAB Central</a>, where people have shared nice examples, even little apps they’ve created. I think many of us are buried in data and just not sure what to do with it, so definitely take advantage of what’s already out there in the community. You can explore and see what makes sense to you, and bring in that balance of domain knowledge and the insight you get from the tools and AI.</p><p><strong>What should engineers and designers consider wh</strong><strong>en using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Think through what problems you’re trying to solve or what insights you might hope to find, and try to be clear about that. Consider all of the different components, and document and test each of those different parts. Consider all of the people involved, and explain and hand off in a way that is sensible for the whole team.</p><p><strong>How do you think AI will affect chip designers’ jobs?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> It’s going to free up a lot of human capital for more advanced tasks. We can use AI to reduce waste, to optimize the materials, to optimize the design, but then you still have that human involved whenever it comes to decision-making. I think it’s a great example of people and technology working hand in hand. It’s also an industry where all people involved—even on the manufacturing floor—need to have some level of understanding of what’s happening, so this is a great industry for advancing AI because of how we test things and how we think about them before we put them on the chip.</p><p><strong>How do you envision the future of AI and chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr</strong><strong>:</strong> It’s very much dependent on that human element—involving people in the process and having that interpretable model. We can do many things with the mathematical minutiae of modeling, but it comes down to how people are using it, how everybody in the process is understanding and applying it. Communication and involvement of people of all skill levels in the process are going to be really important. We’re going to see less of those superprecise predictions and more transparency of information, sharing, and that digital twin—not only using AI but also using our human knowledge and all of the work that many people have done over the years.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-chip-design-matlab</guid><category>Chip fabrication</category><category>Matlab</category><category>Moore’s law</category><category>Chip design</category><category>Ai</category><category>Digital twins</category><dc:creator>Rina Diane Caballar</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/layered-rendering-of-colorful-semiconductor-wafers-with-a-bright-white-light-sitting-on-one.jpg?id=29285079&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Atomically Thin Materials Significantly Shrink Qubits</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit</link><description><![CDATA[

Of these challenges two critical issues stand out: miniaturization and qubit quality.</p><p>IBM has adopted the superconducting qubit road map of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibms-envisons-the-road-to-quantum-computing-like-an-apollo-mission" target="_self">reaching a 1,121-qubit processor by 2023</a>, leading to the expectation that 1,000 qubits with today’s qubit form factor is feasible. However, current approaches will require very large chips (50 millimeters on a side, or larger) at the scale of small wafers, or the use of chiplets on multichip modules. While this approach will work, the aim is to attain a better path toward scalability.</p><p>Now researchers at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01187-w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT have been able to both reduce the size of the qubits</a> and done so in a way that reduces the interference that occurs between neighboring qubits. The MIT researchers have increased the number of superconducting qubits that can be added onto a device by a factor of 100.</p><p>“We are addressing both qubit miniaturization and quality,” said <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/william-d-oliver/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Oliver</a>, the director for the <a href="https://cqe.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Quantum Engineering</a> at MIT. “Unlike conventional transistor scaling, where only the number really matters, for qubits, large numbers are not sufficient, they must also be high-performance. Sacrificing performance for qubit number is not a useful trade in quantum computing. They must go hand in hand.”</p><p>The key to this big increase in qubit density and reduction of interference comes down to the use of two-dimensional materials, in particular the 2D insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The MIT researchers demonstrated that a few atomic monolayers of hBN can be stacked to form the insulator in the capacitors of a superconducting qubit.</p><p>Just like other capacitors, the capacitors in these superconducting circuits take the form of a sandwich in which an insulator material is sandwiched between two metal plates. The big difference for these capacitors is that the superconducting circuits can operate only at extremely low temperatures—less than 0.02 degrees above absolute zero (-273.15 °C).</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." style="max-width: 100%;">Superconducting qubits are measured at temperatures as low as 20 millikelvin in a dilution refrigerator.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..." style="max-width: 100%;">Nathan Fiske/MIT</small></p><p>In that environment, insulating materials that are available for the job, such as PE-CVD silicon oxide or silicon nitride, have quite a few defects that are too lossy for quantum computing applications. To get around these material shortcomings, most superconducting circuits use what are called coplanar capacitors. In these capacitors, the plates are positioned laterally to one another, rather than on top of one another.</p><p>As a result, the intrinsic silicon substrate below the plates and to a smaller degree the vacuum above the plates serve as the capacitor dielectric. Intrinsic silicon is chemically pure and therefore has few defects, and the large size dilutes the electric field at the plate interfaces, all of which leads to a low-loss capacitor. The lateral size of each plate in this open-face design ends up being quite large (typically 100 by 100 micrometers) in order to achieve the required capacitance.</p><p>In an effort to move away from the large lateral configuration, the MIT researchers embarked on a search for an insulator that has very few defects and is compatible with superconducting capacitor plates.</p><p>“We chose to study hBN because it is the most widely used insulator in 2D material research due to its cleanliness and chemical inertness,” said colead author <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/joel-wang/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joel Wang</a>, a research scientist in the Engineering Quantum Systems group of the MIT Research Laboratory for Electronics. </p><p>On either side of the hBN, the MIT researchers used the 2D superconducting material, niobium diselenide. One of the trickiest aspects of fabricating the capacitors was working with the niobium diselenide, which oxidizes in seconds when exposed to air, according to Wang. This necessitates that the assembly of the capacitor occur in a glove box filled with argon gas.</p><p>While this would seemingly complicate the scaling up of the production of these capacitors, Wang doesn’t regard this as a limiting factor.</p><p>“What determines the quality factor of the capacitor are the two interfaces between the two materials,” said Wang. “Once the sandwich is made, the two interfaces are “sealed” and we don’t see any noticeable degradation over time when exposed to the atmosphere.”</p><p>This lack of degradation is because around 90 percent of the electric field is contained within the sandwich structure, so the oxidation of the outer surface of the niobium diselenide does not play a significant role anymore. This ultimately makes the capacitor footprint much smaller, and it accounts for the reduction in cross talk between the neighboring qubits.</p><p>“The main challenge for scaling up the fabrication will be the wafer-scale growth of hBN and 2D superconductors like [niobium diselenide], and how one can do wafer-scale stacking of these films,” added Wang.</p><p>Wang believes that this research has shown 2D hBN to be a good insulator candidate for superconducting qubits. He says that the groundwork the MIT team has done will serve as a road map for using other hybrid 2D materials to build superconducting circuits.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:12:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit</guid><category>Quantum computing</category><category>2d materials</category><category>Ibm</category><category>Qubits</category><category>Hexagonal boron nitride</category><category>Superconducting qubits</category><category>Mit</category><dc:creator>Dexter Johnson</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-golden-square-package-holds-a-small-processor-sitting-on-top-is-a-metal-square-with-mit-etched-into-it.jpg?id=29281587&amp;width=980"></media:content></item></channel></rss>
